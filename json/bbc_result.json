The Patel community is demanding quotas in educational institutions and government jobs. Politician and writer Shashi Tharoor explains why India needs a new debate on affirmative action.India has been shaken, and its thriving state of Gujarat paralysed, by a by its influential Patel community.Millions gathered in the state's major towns under the surprisingly belligerent leadership of a hitherto unknown 22-year-old called , clamouring for their caste to be granted affirmative-action benefits known as \"reservations\".  Violence erupted, property was damaged, eight lives were lost and the army was called in. Hardik Patel was briefly arrested and, when his arrest sparked fury and more violence, released. The agitation damaged not only property and people but also some of the fundamental assumptions of Indian politics. India's constitution, adopted in 1950,  inaugurated the world's oldest and farthest-reaching affirmative action programme, guaranteeing  - the most disadvantaged groups in Hinduism's hierarchy - not only equality of opportunity but guaranteed outcomes, with reserved places in educational institutions, government  jobs and even seats in parliament and the state assemblies. These \"reservations\" or quotas were granted to groups on the basis of their (presumably immutable) caste identities. The logic of reservations in India was simple: they were justified as a means of making up for millennia of discrimination based on birth. It was a small way of compensating the millions of unfortunates who suffered daily the inequities and humiliations of untouchability. Reservations became more political in 1989, when the -led government of the day decided to extend their benefits to Other Backward Classes (OBCs), based on the recommendations of the . The OBCs hailed from the lower and intermediate castes who were deemed backward because they lacked \"upper caste\" status.As more and more people sought fewer available government and university positions, we witnessed the unedifying (and unwittingly hilarious) spectacle of castes fighting with each other to be declared backward: the competitive zeal of the Meena and the Gujjar communities in Rajasthan, castes not originally listed as OBCs, to be deemed more backward than each other would be funny if both sides weren't so deadly serious. As an uncle of mine sagely observed, \"In our country now, you can't go forward unless you're a backward.\"The Patels, however, are an unlikely caste to be seeking such recognition: they are in fact dominant in Gujarat, prominent, successful and wealthy beyond their share of 15% of the state's population.  Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel is from the community; several Patels occupy important portfolios in her cabinet.  says the majority of his fellow Patels are less well off. But to suggest that the caste as a whole deserves reservations strikes most people of Gujarat as absurd.The problem, as all too often in India, is politics. India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had hoped that caste consciousness would wither away after Independence, but the opposite has happened. Because caste was such a powerful source of self-identification, it proved to be a useful tool of political mobilisation in India's electoral democracy: when an Indian casts his vote, he too often votes his caste. Granting sops to various castes proved a major vote-catcher for India's politicians. The number benefiting from such sops varies from state to state, but has reached extreme proportions in a state like Tamil Nadu, where 69% of government jobs and educational positions are reserved for a range of deprived and disadvantaged castes - so much so that the state has a cottage industry of fake caste certificates for Brahmins seeking to pass themselves off asInevitably, a backlash has set in, with members of the forward castes decrying the unfairness of affirmative action in perpetuity, and asking whether it is reasonable, for instance, that the daughter of a senior government servant from a backward caste should benefit from reservations while the son of his upper-caste driver or clerk competes for limited unreserved seats.Some argue for reservations to no longer be caste-based but tied only to economic criteria, with the poorest of all castes benefiting from them rather than the better-off of some castes. (Many suspect that Hardik Patel and his fellow Patels aren't really looking for reservations: by demanding the impossible, they are actually seeking the abolition of the present system.) The current beneficiary castes, however, respond hotly that such a change overlooks the social discrimination that comes with, for example, the stigma of untouchability: however prosperous a Dalit family, many upper-caste Indians would not grant it respect unless its members enjoyed the status that comes with, for instance, a government position.Gujarat's Patel agitation has succeeded in starting a nationwide debate on reservations. It has an interesting partner in India's Supreme Court, which earlier this year The judges' rationale was that the state should not go by the \"perception of the self-proclaimed socially backward class or advanced classes\" on whether they deserved to be categorised among the \"less fortunates\". Most significantly, the court held that caste, while acknowledged to be a prominent cause of injustice in the country historically, could not be the sole determinant of the backwardness of a class. While caste may be a prominent factor for \"easy determination of backwardness\", the top court discouraged \"the identification of a group as backward solely on the basis of caste\" and called for \"new practices, methods and yardsticks\" to be evolved. \"The gates would be opened only to permit entry of the most distressed. Any other inclusions would be a serious abdication of the constitutional duty of the State,\" the court warned.This suggests that the Patel's demands to be classified as OBCs will not stand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. But it also suggests that India's entire range of affirmative action practices will need to be reviewed. The battle has truly been joined.", "continent": ""},

Barbara Janecek shared her own tale in response. She had , whose father Nan Young, a Chinese ship engineer, was sent back to the Far East following the end of the war. He was one of thousands of recruits from Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong who lived in Liverpool.\"I was always waiting for my father to come back, I was always daydreaming he would,\" says Barbara, whose father John had suffered the same fate. John Ong had married Eileen Hing in 1943 when they were both aged 23. Eileen was devastated when her husband left, leaving his wife to raise three children under the age of four.Her mother lived mostly on credit and it was a meagre existence. She would send her children to the corner shop to ask for broken biscuits and pieces off the end of the meat. Once her brother was asked to take a plate to school for the Christmas party and it broke while he made his way home. He burst into tears, realising the family would not have the means to replace it easily. Barbara survived tuberculosis, which she contracted aged two. Peter overcame rickets.Eileen would spend her evenings working at the Golden Dragon restaurant in a bid to make ends meet. \"At night we three children would sneak upstairs to visit old seaman Yau. Old Yau would share his watered down rice and cooked dried mandarin peel with three very hungry little children. What a feast that was.\"She recalls the exotic animals which were brought into the basement of the \"very dilapidated\" Victorian house on Upper Stanhope Street in which they lived. \"I remember one day I got home from school and there was a beautiful little turtle. It was orange and black. We were fascinated by this. I'm sure it must have died.\"One time we had a little monkey but it was very vicious so it didn't last very long in our house. He didn't bite us but he used to bite other people. When I look back it wasn't really an unhappy childhood.\"Five or six years ago, the 70-year-old heard the story of her father's return to Liverpool, which she says \"still makes me very sad\". \"Supposedly my father came back to England for us,\" Barbara explains. But the family had already moved on. \"I don't really know the situation or the circumstance but he knocked on either my mother's door or a neighbour's door and he asked about her. \"This woman said 'she's now married and she has another husband'.\" It was understandable that with the passing of time, it would be assumed that John would never return. \"My mother didn't know where my father had gone. She had waited seven years and never heard anything.\"Barbara suggests the children may have been sent to London at that time and it wasn't until much later that they learned of this visit.\"That made me very sad to think he wanted us. My younger brother felt he had deserted us and felt so much animosity towards this young father.\"\"My mother didn't know she was pregnant when my father was sent away,\" Barbara adds. She later heard from an aunt that her mother had unsuccessfully tried to abort the child. \"It was not an uncommon thing with women in those days.\"Eileen had told her children very little about their father. The fact that he played the piano and violin and rode a motorcycle were a few of the only details they had to cling on to.\"I don't think about this very often but when I do it's very bittersweet,\" she adds. \"How I wished I knew more.\"", "continent": ""},

But in the spring the small Himalayan mountain nation shocked the world when it won a World Cup qualifying match against Sri Lanka. Now they have high hopes. Changlimithang football stadium is more like a palace than a sports ground. It was built in 1974 for the coronation of Bhutan's fourth king and the pitch is built on a famous battle ground. The stadium was full for the final match to see who would win Bhutan's tiny football league, which consists of six teams. Among the spectators who saw Terton FC beat Druk Pol two-nil was Ugen Tshechup, president of Bhutan's football federation, and one of the men responsible for bringing football to Bhutan. He was part of a generation of well-to-do Bhutanese who were sent away to boarding school in India, where he developed a passion for the sport. \"Ever since I was small I used to play for the school team and after that when I was at university I used to play for my college team and when I came back I got involved,\" says Tshechup. \"Prior to democracy we always had ministers who would take up the post of the president of the football federation but after democracy I got encouraged, stood for elections, and I won.\" What characterises football in Bhutan is the tenacious attitude of the players. It's something he first noticed among his Bhutanese friends when he was at school in India. \"We never gave up - we could be down 2-0, 3-0, 4-0, but we kept running and chasing, and this is what I've asked my team to do.\" Unfortunately for Tshechup, his national squad were earlier this year named the worst football team in the world - but this didn't faze him. Up until very recently he didn't have ambitions for his team to play international games. There simply wasn't any money to send the national team abroad. The little money he had was spent building football pitches and funding a youth programme. It was only when Fifa offered to fund their entry into the World Cup that he decided to take a chance. And to his surprise Bhutan won its very first qualifying match. It literally knocked him off his feet. \"I was sitting up in the pavilion and I jumped, not realising how high up I was,\" he says. \"Sometimes it brings the child out in you. When you see your team score a goal it does send chills down your spine, and at that very moment you suddenly feel, 'What if?' But then after 10, 15 minutes reality sinks in and says, 'OK, the hard road to the next leg is going to start.'\"  Tshechup's very realistic about Bhutan's chances and he says he's not going to focus all his attention on the national team. There's still so much to do to at home if football is to be a successful sport in Bhutan. \"Winning inspires people. Winning creates heroes and stars and encourages you to play - but at the same time when they go out and find that they can't get a football, they don't have a proper ground to play on, the proper coaches are not there to teach them the proper techniques, then it would not fulfil the obligations and the vision we have for football in Bhutan.\" Good coaches are expensive, and the Bhutan football federation cannot afford one - but coaches have been coming to Bhutan through the assistance of Japan's football federation.  \"Sometimes we have had very good ones, sometimes not so good ones, but this time we feel that the coach is very experienced, he understands how the people here think, so hopefully he will be able to deliver success,\" says Tshechup. Up in the top row of the stadium Coach Tsukitate Norio is watching the league game. Three of the players on the pitch are in the national team which he is responsible for - and he's not looking impressed. \"Not enough tactics, not enough technique, look - no running! That's why I'm shouting in the training: 'Why are you walking?'\" But he has no time to talk to the squad after the league match. \"I'm tired, I have to rest - I want to drink beer,\" he jokes. The next day coach Tsukitate is in a more serious frame of mind. It's back to business and the players are working hard. They are all amateur footballers - many are students or recently graduated and working. The team captain, Karma Tshedup, is an airline pilot for Bhutan's national airline, Druk air. \"People always ask me how I get time to train but I always ask for Mondays and Fridays off so I can train with the national team,\" says Tshedup. \"We don't have a very professional mentality, but due to the win against Sri Lanka there are a lot of people coming to watch and support football so in that way what we are trying to do is to make football a profession in Bhutan as well.\" As a child, Tshedup dreamt of being a footballer - failing that, he wanted to be a pilot. \"In a way I'm fulfilling both my dreams,\" he says. Everybody hopes the team will win more matches in a qualifying group that also contains Qatar, China, the Maldives and Hong Kong. But they are realistic, and with reason - in their next two games they lost 7:0 away to Hong Kong and 6:0 at home to China. \"Even though Hong Kong is ranked lower than us, it's still a better team,\" said Tshedup before the game.  He warned that his players had their work cut out and the coach should be on his mettle.\"He has to at least show us that the team is better than Sri Lanka, that he's introduced some of his techniques and hopefully it will translate into our boys playing well.\" Meanwhile, Tshedup has given the team a pep-talk of his own.  \"You're going in as an underdog, probably you'll have a lot of goals scored against you - don't give up. Keep your heart out on the pitch - if you do that, we're going to be very proud of you and for us you'll come back heroes.\" ", "continent": ""},

Things you might not know about the Northern Territory", "news_content": "Best known for crocodiles, camels and colourful characters, Australia's Northern Territory (NT) could become the country's seventh state as early as July 2018.There are various hurdles to jump before that happens but the change would mean more senators from the NT in Federal Parliament, a new name and likely a redesign of the national flag.Here are some things you might not know about Australia's outback territory. A mix of Indigenous, British and Asian influences set against a backdrop of stunning, wild scenery has created what is possibly Australia's most unique region.Closer to Bali than to Bondi, the NT spans about 1.35 million sq km (838,000 sq miles), more than six times the size of the UK.It is in the central north of the country, between the states of Western Australia and Queensland.It has two starkly different climates: tropical in the north with a wet and dry season, but in the south the desert centre sees very little rain.With about 240,000 people it is the least populated of Australia's self-governing mainland states and territories.Indigenous Australians have lived in the NT for more than 60,000 years and today represent about 30% of the population, according to the Territory government.Development came late in Australia's modern history with the port of Darwin established in 1869. At one point, the Chinese population outnumbered Europeans.Indigenous Australians have traditionally believed in what has been described as songlines, or dreaming tracks, that mark the routes followed by spirit beings.Today, the NT is home to some of Australia's most acclaimed singers and musicians, including Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, pop export Jessica Mauboy and the ground breaking Yothu Yindi who combined traditional Aboriginal music with modern western instrumentation.The old adage \"never smile at a crocodile\" couldn't be more appropriate for Territorians and visitors.Most rivers in the region have, on average, five crocodiles per kilometre so it's not surprising authorities this year urged tourists not to take selfies near the world's deadliest predators.Invasive species pose a danger of a different sort. Feral animals such as camels, cane toads, cats and pigs, among many others, do untold damage to NT flora and fauna.In 1860s, Afghan cameleers brought their \"ships of the desert\" to the Australian outback. More than a century later, feral camel populations peaked at about one million. By 2013, populations were nearly halved in a controversial cull. Even so, it is estimated that camels still roam across about 40% of the Territory.A deadly cane toad has also caused chaos after it was introduced from South America in 1935 in a bid to kill a native beetle that was damaging sugar cane crops.With no local predators, cane toad numbers have grown rapidly, spreading to Western Australia and down the east coast, in recent years. Venom secreted by glands in their back can quickly kill native animals that try to feed on them.In a little known chapter in Australia's military history, Australia came under foreign attack for the first time, in World War Two, when Japanese forces launched air raids on the city of Darwin and other targets in the Territory.In the largest Japanese attack after Pearl Harbour, 188 Japanese planes were launched against the northern capital and its harbour full of Allied ships.Up to 1100 people were killed in the surprise attack.Darwin was also the site of one of Australia's worst natural disasters, devastated on Christmas Eve 1974 by Cyclone Tracy.Tracy killed 71 people and destroyed more than 70% of Darwin's buildings, including 80% of all homes.Most of the population was evacuated to other Australian cities and many residents never returned to Darwin.The NT has its share of crime and is home to two of Australia's biggest unsolved mysteries: the death of baby Azaria Chamberlain in 1980, and the disappearance of English tourist Peter Falconio in 2001.Australians Lindy and Michael Chamberlain were camping at Uluru when their baby girl Azaria disappeared from the family's tent.Her body was never found but her parents told police a dingo took the child.In 1982, Lindy was found guilty of murdering Azaria and her husband was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact.In what became one of Australia's most sensational court cases, much of the police evidence was controversial and the nation was divided over the couple's guilt.Lindy was released in 1986 after new evidence came to light and finally, in 2012, a coroner ruled Azaria had been taken by a dingo. Backpacker Peter Falconio's body was never found either but his girlfriend Joanne Lees maintains the couple was attacked by Bradley John Murdoch - mechanic and admitted drug runner.He had flagged down their campervan while they were travelling on an outback highway in the dead of night, a court later heard. Lees escaped, later telling police she heard Murdoch shoot her boyfriend. Murdoch was arrested following one of Australia's largest manhunts, and eventually found guilty of Falconio's murder.", "continent": ""},

Infrastrata's chief executive Andrew Hindle said, while he was disappointed that Larne would no longer be taking part, \"significant progress has been made in recent months towards drilling the first exploration well on the PL1/10 licence area in over 40 years.\"The lower costs of onshore operation mean that onshore projects are expected to remain profitable at lower oil prices if they were to persist.\"The company remains fully committed to the Woodburn Forest-1 well and is actively pursuing a number of options to secure alternative funding for it to be drilled as soon as practicable.\"", "continent": ""},

But even among this exalted company William Ash - the model for the character played by Steve McQueen in The Great Escape - stands out, writes the author of a new biography, Patrick Bishop. Ash was an American who, while his country was still reluctant to enter the war, crossed into Canada to train as a pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He was posted to Britain and flew Spitfires with 411 Squadron.In March 1942 he was shot down over northern France but escaped from the wreckage of his plane and was given shelter by a number of courageous French women and men. He was captured in Paris by the Gestapo and condemned to death. His life was saved by the Luftwaffe who argued that as an airman, Ash was their prisoner.He spent the rest of the war in a number of Prisoner of War camps. But instead of being grateful for his salvation he became an obsessive \"escapologist\" - seeking to break free by whatever means came his way.When Ash died aged 96 last year his obituaries noted that he was said to have been the model for Virgil Hilts, the lean, leather-jacketed airman played by Steve McQueen in the 1963 film The Great Escape. Hilts makes a doomed attempt to reach freedom by jumping the barbed wire fences on the German-Swiss border on a stolen motorcycle.Ash modestly denied the claim. For one thing he didn't ride a motorbike, he said.  For another, he did not take part in the breakout from the Stalag Luft III camp, on which the movie is based.But the reason he did not participate is that he was locked up in the \"cooler\" - as the camp jail was called - as punishment for another escape attempt. Bill was every bit as charismatic as the fictional Hilts with whom he shared many characteristics. Apart from being American, he was good looking, dashing and more than a bit of a rebel. He was also delightfully self-deprecating. He described some of his exploits in his writings, though he often underplayed his sufferings and achievements.  He had a tough upbringing in Depression-hit Texas where his father struggled to bring up a family on what he made from his job as a travelling salesman. Young Bill worked his way through university but could find no job at the end of it and spent months riding the rails as a hobo, seeking whatever work he could get.His experiences shaped his political views. He was too young to join the idealistic Americans fighting Franco's nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. But when World War Two broke out, he was determined to do his bit to combat fascism.It rankled with him that he did not do more fighting. He only managed to shoot down one German aircraft for certain before he was downed himself. He decided to use his incarceration to wage war on the enemy by other means.Most of his fellow inmates had little interest in escaping. Having survived the trauma of being shot down, the majority decided they had used up their store of luck and tried to pass the time behind the wire as best they could, often studying and acquiring new skills, while they waited for the war to end.Bill Ash belonged to a hard core devoted to overcoming every obstacle the Germans put in their way to returning home and carrying on the fight. They often found it hard to analyse precisely their motivations. Some felt it was their duty. For others, focusing on a project was a way of combating the stultifying boredom. In Bill's case it boiled down, he said, to \"an unwillingness to crawl in the face of oppression\".He lost count of his escape attempts, or the number of times he was condemned to a spell in the cooler, which meant solitary confinement and a bread and water diet. Some of the escape bids were opportunistic efforts like the time he wangled his way on to a work detail tasked with unloading a train then made a run for it when the guards' backs were turned.Others were complex, long-term schemes that required a huge amount of organisation, ingenuity and endurance.  A little-known but extraordinarily ambitious project was the Latrine Tunnel Escape which took place in Oflag XXIB, a camp near the Polish town of Szubin.Bill had a hand in devising the plan, which was not for the faint-hearted. It involved digging a tunnel more than 100 yards long from a starting point beneath a large lavatory block. Every day for three months teams of diggers would lower themselves through a trap door set into a toilet seat trying to avoid falling into the lake of raw sewage beneath. An entrance set into wall of the latrine pit led into a chamber where the tunnel began.Day after day they would scrape away at the sandy soil working by the light of margarine lamps. They lived in fear of cave-ins and asphyxiation and panic attacks brought on by claustrophobia.Tunnelling was in some ways the easy part. To stand any chance of making it out of Nazi-controlled territory they needed civilian-style clothing, money, and documents. Here they were helped by other prisoners who brought a wide variety of skills either acquired in peacetime or learned in the camp.Eventually, one night early in March 1943, 35 men dressed in outfits fashioned from Air Force uniform and blankets and armed with convincingly forged identity cards crawled through the narrow tunnel and under the perimeter fence to freedom.One managed to get as far as the Swiss border before being recaptured. Two made it to the Baltic and were on their way in a rowing boat to neutral Sweden when they disappeared, presumed drowned. All the rest were recaptured within a few days.It was a bitter disappointment, but almost all carried on trying to escape. Bill finally succeeded a few days before the war ended, breaking out of a camp near Bremen just as the British Army arrived.His experiences as a prisoner had a profound effect on his political outlook. After the war he stayed on in Britain and seemed set to follow some of his camp comrades - like Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Tony Barber and TV presenter and historian Robert Kee - into a successful conventional career.He went to Oxford University and joined the BBC, which gave him a top administrative job in India. His increasingly radical views made it hard for him to conform, however. He rejected the Communist Party of Great Britain as being too compromised and helped found a breakaway group. He also lost his full-time job with the BBC, though he continued to do some work for the drama department. Ash was a happy and gregarious man who never lost a touch of his boyhood innocence. His career as an escapologist showed him that in wartime people were capable of extraordinary selflessness. Why was it, he wondered, that this spirit could not be carried on into peacetime?", "continent": ""},

All four clubs will be \"speaking the same business language\" by using the same systems, and swapping best practice when it comes to marketing, for example, as well as enabling the quartet to stay efficiently inter-connected.However, on the more visionary, and, as Mr Soriano says, \"emotional\" fronts, CFG believes the SAP tie-up will be of huge value in revolutionising both their playing and fan operations.All Premier League clubs have data analysts, as do many in the lower divisions, with stats crunched on everything from the distance covered by a player in a game to the number of crosses played with either foot. In fact, every step on the pitch is monitored now.  Similarly, away from match day, thousands of hours of training data is accumulated, while injury, dietary, sleep and medical data is also harvested and studied.Assisted by SAP, which worked with the successful German 2014 World Cup-winning squad, the teams will use the insights derived from this data to produce everything from individual player coaching and training programmes, to tactics tailored to counter each opposition team.But CFG, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group, believes that all this sports data could eventually be condensed and a whole whole new way of playing emerge.\"Technology will allow us to play better football,\" says Mr Soriano, who formerly worked at Spanish giant Barcelona.\"We are going to work together in finding new ways of understanding the game, and designing a better game to help us win.\"That vision of creating a new way of playing - a new Total Football or tiki-taka for the future - is shared by colleague and former player, Brian Marwood.He won a league title with Arsenal in 1988/89, and is managing director of the football group's City Football Services. He oversees the recruitment, development, training and management of hundreds of players in Manchester and at other global training centres.\"We have a great opportunity to lead in football, and are searching for the next trend. which will keep us ahead of everyone else,\" says Mr Marwood.\"We have got a team of people trying to find out what the next 10 to 20 years of football will look like. We want to be ahead of the game.\"To that end, a research and innovation group for all four clubs is being created.Another major goal is to use data to enhance the fan experience.CFG believes that with SAP's assistance they can change the way supporters of the group's four teams access and consume football data.Tom Glick, president of New York City FC says that CFG will be looking to enhance the viewing experience of fans, whether \"glued to the action\" at the stadium, or sitting at home watching on TV.\"The task of finding new ways to get this information to the fans starts now,\" he says. \"We will be asking them what additional information and data about the game and players they would look to see - what is important to them.\"The first innovation in this area will be a large digital statistics wall installed at Man City's Etihad Stadium from next season, which will show player and match statistics from the previous game.\"I can see the attraction in providing supporters with access to match data, particularly among the younger tech-aware generation in their teens and twenties,\" says Kevin Parker, secretary of the Man City supporters club.\"We have all got an opinion on how our players are playing during a game and whether a particular player - for example Fernandinho - has worked as hard or not as it appears to fans at the game,\" he says.\"Or you can confirm whether David Silva or Yaya Toure have played those key passes that you thought they had. That can all add to the whole spectacle and enjoyment of the game, and provide talking points.\"But he warns that \"some of the more vociferous elements at a match might get on a player's back\" if their match data was not impressive.He also says data overload might be a danger, particularly if chewing over match statistics at home overshadows the experience of attending a game in the flesh.\"Any data has to be handled and presented in the right way,\" he says.Meanwhile, the next step in enhancing that data collection for the group of clubs will be this October, when Melbourne City FC take to wearing player monitors during Australian league games. \"We believe we are doing something that has never been done before, around the world,\" says group chief executive Soriano of the tech route ahead. \"We have to take risks, innovate, make mistakes.\"", "continent": ""},

It now has an average weekly sale of less than 25,000. It doesn't have its own staff any more, relying on a journalism pool shared with its stablemate, The Scotsman. \"SoS\" is now being beaten by the only weekly \"regional\" paper to register a rise in print sales, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Sunday Herald looked to be on its last legs, but found a niche by backing the independence cause.Approving \"Yes\" campaigners backed it, with a big lift in the back half of last year, from which it's fallen back, but still retained an average 29,000 weekly sales.Its publisher, Newsquest, also saw a gap in the daily market for pro-independence readers. Although the figures aren't audited, we're told they're selling nearly 17,000 a day.These are small numbers when set alongside the total sale of newspapers. The constitutional debate may have polarised opinion and changed some buying behaviour, but it can be overstated. The decline of sales in Scotland has recently been steeper than those for the rest of the UK, but the trends are similar.Meanwhile, publishers point out there's a rise in online readership. But that's not making them enough money to sustain their cost bases. In the case of the Scotsman's figures, daily online readers are down 33% since a busy referendum period.Those news publishers are competing with broadcasters for online readers. We've just got half year figures for STV which show  it aiming to achieve its turnaround by the end of next year.A high priority is the desire to find a new earner from making drama series, as royalties from Taggart re-runs fade to black.It's finding the transition and investing in new services can be expensive, with an \u00a3800,000 half-year loss on its two city stations, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh.They're being watched by 900,000 people in the average month which, we're told, is 30% of the potential audience. The Glasgow channel is being aimed at break-even by the end of this year.STV also lost a wad of cash by having to bail out Mirriad, a digital advertising firm in which it invested. It may have failed to raise the finance needed without the bail-out, but it's clever stuff, \"advertising to the skip generation\", with personalised product placement embedded in video content.For instance, a music video might have a street scene, in which a background billboard has ads which differ, depending on who is viewing.Advertising is not part of the BBC debate. Not yet anyway. But as the future of the licence fee is discussed, they are a sort of subliminal presence on the background billboards. A project, financed by the BBC and published this week, sought to find out how small groups of people responded to living without the corporation's TV, radio and online content for a few days.It concluded the group who resented having to pay the annual \u00a3145.50 missed it more than they expected, and some were despairing at the impact of adverts on their viewing of commercial channels.Commissioning that research is part of the BBC's fight for its very existence, at least if you believe some of the interpretation of the government's green paper on how the next 10-year charter is going to change things. The charter is due to start from the end of next year. We're half way through the consultation on that, and so far the UK government appears to have retreated from the early briefings to delighted print rivals that Auntie might as well be put in a retirement home, her funding clipped, with a remit to leave popular entertainment to the commercial market-place.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has been in Edinburgh for its International TV Festival this week, making reassuringly supportive comments about the BBC. He'll be aware that it has a lot of fans mobilised to defend it, including some formidable cultural celebrities. Some, including Armando Ianucci and Sue Perkins, used the Festival platform to sound off.The context of the debate on the BBC's future in Scotland is, of course, rather different. The broadcaster's fans have not rushed forward to argue the case for it. The independence referendum seems to have left a bruised legacy of reluctance to engage.It also left a legacy of a starkly changed political landscape, to which the BBC has to respond, even if Mr Whittingdale's green paper didn't make much of it. The document only noted the Smith Commission's agreement that the BBC should be answerable to Holyrood on a similar basis to its accountability at Westminster (note that it's accountable for its management and use of resources, rather than its output and journalism).On the pro-independence side, there's some tacit awareness that the broadcasting section was hardly the most compelling part of the Scottish government white paper. It proposed a new Scottish broadcaster while somehow ensuring that all the popular BBC stuff was retained.Less tacit are vociferous critics of the BBC's political coverage, including pro-independence websites and bloggers, some threatening mass non-payment of the licence fee.Having mobilised protests outside the BBC last year, that element continues to be fired up by Alex Salmond, in his newspaper column and promoting his book, with ever stronger condemnations of the BBC's referendum coverage.The body set up to represent viewers, listeners and readers, the Audience Council of Scotland, took 10 months to . When it did, it was both supportive and quite challenging of the corporation's coverage. It said online was of \"exceptional quality\" (including something called \"expert economic analysis\" - though if there was, I missed it). But it also said coverage failed to respond to the change in campaigning style, as grass roots and social media played such a significant role.The Council pointed to \"an opportunity to review issues in the light of experience in the referendum\", though it stopped short of explicitly calling for one.So that was the complex background to Alex Salmond's successor, previously with little to say on the subject, Nicola Sturgeon said she approached the subject with trepidation. Her speech was very carefully worded. It's hard to believe this was anything like the speech Alex Salmond would have delivered.Criticism of the BBC's campaign coverage last year was measured. The first minister said she saw no \"institutional bias\", and praised at least some BBC Scotland journalism. She went on to argue that there was a failure to strike the right balance between holding independence plans up to scrutiny on a parallel basis with the prospects for remaining within the UK. \"The status quo and the consequences of voting 'No' were not really analysed at all,\" she claimed, voicing the irritation of those who feel there wasn't a level playing field. And she cited the Audience Council in support of her view that London-based journalists had failed to catch the mood of Scots audiences. Their broad brush reports jarred, it was argued, with the detailed scrutiny of issues that had long been debated at every level of Scottish society.BBC management responded to her speech with a statement beginning: \"We believe our coverage of the referendum was rigorously impartial and in line with our guidelines on fairness and impartiality\". The Sturgeon speech then turned its focus on the future. For her followers, it's worth noting a change of direction - no longer talk of a Scottish Broadcasting Service splitting from the BBC, but a federal structure.The design appears to allow for either devolution or independence. That way, it helps to disarm Ms Sturgeon's constitutional opponents in their claims that an independent Scotland would be deprived of Eastenders, Strictly Come Dancing and Sir David Attenborough.The governance requires a Scottish board of overseers, she said, while the output requires a Scottish TV channel (in addition to BBC Alba in Gaelic), and a sibling station for BBC Radio Scotland.Her most forthright criticism was of the BBC's past attempts to avoid becoming a leader of constitutional change by refusing the pressure to split its flagship network news coverage, at 6 and 10 o'clock, for a different perspective from Scotland for Scots.\"The criticism that should be levied at the BBC is not that it has tried to lead constitutional change,\" said the first minister. \"It is that it has totally failed to follow it.\"The UK has changed dramatically since devolution, but broadcasters are still catching up with its consequences. And although that poses questions for all public service broadcasters, the issue is maybe most acute with the BBC.\"The message was aimed at Mr Whittingdale to some extent, but more so at the BBC. So how will it respond?Last month, the official answer to concerns about a lack of trust was to point to large audiences for the flagship news programme, Reporting Scotland. And even last month, these were \"early days\" for a debate about changes to governance.Not any longer. Not with a BBC Trust survey finding that only 48% of Scots think that the corporation reflects their lives. That's lower than other parts of the UK. That BBC spokesman's reaction to the first minister's speech continued: \"We recognise that there is audience demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on all BBC services and we want this to be part of our response in charter review. \"The BBC's funding has now been set for the next five years and this will mean cuts across the BBC.\"We will have to balance our investment on pan-UK services with dedicated services in the Nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). We will aim to protect spending in the Nations so that content investment is cut less than in other parts of the BBC.\"Expect more on that from the Beeb next month. With the first minister's speech, an important debate on the future of the media in Scotland has only (at last) just begun.", "continent": ""},

Now a scheme in India is aiming to instil better toilet habits in children by \"paying them to poo\".Open defecation is a practice where people relieve themselves in fields, bushes, open spaces and into open bodies of water.It poses a serious threat to the health of children. Hundreds of thousands of children die every year because of diseases transmitted through human waste.In India, nearly half of the population - more than 590m people - relieve themselves in the open.For many it's a daily ritual and often something they do even when public facilities are available.   Now a state council in the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad has come up with a scheme where children are being paid to use public toilets.  Campaigners hope it will improve the situation in a country where diseases such as diarrhoea kill about 200,000 children every year.People who live in the slums of Chandoliya in Ahmedabad use the railway tracks to do what most would do only in private, especially early in the morning before the crowds and the heat develop.\"We've made public toilets but people still don't use them,\" said Anil Prajapati, chairman of the Gujarat Sanitation Development Organisation. \"Some of these people fear that there are witches inside or that their children will be kidnapped. \"These people have come from small villages, and so they are not used to the practice.\" When people defecate in the open, flies feed on the waste and then carry small amounts away on their bodies. The flies then come into contact with food. Human waste can also run into wells and streams, contaminating water that may be used for drinking or bathing. Ingested bacteria and worms spread diseases, causing sickness and malnutrition.Faecally transmitted infections are also the main reason why nearly half of Indian children under five are underdeveloped.So health officers at Ahmedabad Municipal Council came up with a new approach to try to encourage residents to use the toilets, some of which are free while others cost money to use.\"We have 320 public toilets and we are not taking any payment in 143 toilets,\" said Dr Bhavin Solanki.\"We have observed some children are still doing open defecation just in front of the pay-and-use.\"So we realised we have to introduce some other scheme.  We are giving one rupee (less than a penny) to the children per day, or we're giving them chocolates to encourage use of the toilets.\"It's a scheme that Bhumi Datadia is taking advantage of. The five-year-old lives in a tiny room with her two siblings and parents.  Like many others in her neighbourhood, a nearby river or public toilets are her only options.\"Look at the size of my house. Where do I have space to build a toilet?\" said Bhumi's mother, Jayashree.Under the new scheme, Bhumi is making one rupee every time she uses a public toilet. Her visits are recorded on a card and she receives her money at the end of the month. \"The toilets are good,\" said Bhumi. \"I will use the money I make for school.\"The city council has plans to scale up the project and it might start paying adults to use public toilets.  \"The idea is to understand you are rewarded for good behaviour,\" said D Thara, commissioner of Ahmedebad Municipal Corporation.\"Once children start using the toilets, adults won't do it any more. Children themselves will become the motivators.\"But people in another part of the city say it won't be easy to convince them to change. They say the toilets are not kept clean and that their children are often stopped from entering the facilities because some of them use too much water.Open defecation also has wider effects on a country, affecting education, income, women's safety and dignity.\"It's not safe for women to go to the toilet in the open,\" said Mr Prajapati.\"When they go out at night, anything can happen. It's happening everywhere in India. We want to stop this.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made eliminating open defecation in India a priority, and wants every home to be installed with a toilet by 2019. In recent years, India has implemented well-funded sanitation campaigns, but few have worked.Some campaigners say that building toilets is not enough and that more needs to be done to reshape attitudes.But the people behind this scheme hope their alternative approach could be a crucial first step towards ending open defecation in India.", "continent": ""},

Happy with the numbers, the first GG Espresso shop opened in 1999.Fast forward to today and there are now 16 GG Espresso cafes across Sydney, which are part of a wider food and hospitality business owned by the Gregans.Called the Gregan Group, it enjoys annual revenues of more than 10 million Australian dollars ($7.3m; \u00a34.7m), and employs 280 people.Mr Gregan, 42, happily admits that being a celebrity helped the business back in its early days, but adds that the boost is only limited.\"It was great for a bit of publicity, but that only goes so far,\" he says. \"There's a bit of noise initially, then you have to deliver.\"It all comes down to performance, and making sure you are consistent, particularly in coffee, because people will walk [somewhere else], particularly now.\"They'll walk another block or two to get the coffee made right, and the coffee they expect.\"While Mr Gregan, who hung up his rugby boots for the last time in 2011, had almost no business experience when the first coffee shop opened, crucially his wife did.Erica had extensive experience of working in the hotels and restaurant sectors.And so to this day, she is the managing director of the Gregan Group, and takes the lead role in the day-to-day running of the Sydney-based business.Meanwhile, while Mr Gregan also takes an active role in leading the business, he balances this with his other work as a rugby commentator.He says: \"My wife is very driven. If you ever met her, she is very good at opening shops, and is really keen to do it well, and have a consistency in the level of our service.\"While the couple's business now extends to bars, restaurants and a catering company, they say they grew it slowly, and using their own money.The only part of the Gregan Group that has outside investors are the two branches of its \"Local Bar\" brand, which have opened since 2011. The Gregans says this investment has come from \"close friends\" rather than any financial institution.Born in Zambia to a Zimbabwean mother and Australian father, Mr Gregan's family moved to Australia when he was still a baby, settling in the capital Canberra.He says his family helped install his drive and determination to succeed, be it in rugby or business.\"My father had his own pharmacy when I was young, but he sold it off and worked for the government in the health department. My mum was a working nurse.\"They worked really hard, so they had a strong work ethic, and I think that always rubs off on you.\"They certainly installed that within me, and they've always been great supporters.\"But how does Mr Gregan - who with 139 caps for Australia remains the joint second most-capped international rugby player - find running a business compares with his old sport?He says: \"You are never going to replicate what the work space was when you were a professional sportsman.\"I had upwards of 60,000 people seeing what I did, watching every mistake you make.\"Yeah, they'd clap and see things you did well, but in a lot of ways you are naked because you are there for everyone to see, there is nowhere to hide.\"Mr Gregan adds: \"In a business you will be judged on results, but not every single eyeball is going to be on what you do. But still, the ability to perform is really critical when it comes to both sport and business.\"While not every star sportsman can go on to be a hit in business,. Mr Gregan thinks many can be taught how to successfully run a company.\"One thing all elite athletes are pretty good at is getting coached, because they have to be coached, so they are good at listening to instructions.\"They are good at deciphering what is important, and what is not.\"Whether retired professional sportsmen or women go into business, or do something else with their lives, Mr Gregan says it is vital that they have a structure to their days and weeks, and a challenge to overcome, to avoid feeling cast adrift.\"It is really important to get involved in business or in a venture which provides that sort of challenge,\" he says. \"I like to have things on the horizon.\"I'm big on shared experience with good people, so you work hard but you have a bit of laughter along the way. Otherwise, what do you live for?\"", "continent": ""},

But there were also overarching findings from this mammoth trawl of data, based on 500,000 teenagers in 65 countries and education systems.For instance, behaviour in class is better now than three years ago.And among better-off countries, the amount spent on education does not seem to have any clear link with improving results.But there were other more specific lessons.The runaway success story has been the achievement of a clutch of Asian education systems. But results saw the OECD's Andreas Schleicher challenging any stereotypes about some places having an inherent \"culture\" of education. Results in  and Vietnam are much better than three years ago, he says, but the \"culture\" hasn't changed. The improvements reflect a deliberate policy of ensuring that a high proportion of pupils will succeed. This also applies in other parts of the world. Poland has been transformed into one of the best school performers in Europe and the OECD argues this reflects an active policy of change and not any inherent quality of its culture. The implication of this is that other countries could follow their example.Is it a good thing to be successful at any price? , but it's at the very bottom in how happy pupils are in school. Punishingly long hours of study, high pressure tests and extra lessons out of school might deliver high results. But is that the system to pursue?In contrast, Peru, Albania and Indonesia, among the lowest test performers, have the highest proportions of children who like being at school.And the Pisa study also showed no clear link between parental choice and better standards - but would parents accept a more controlling, centralised system to raise results?Expect more examination of the relationship between cramming, creativity, choice and happiness.The impact of Pisa as an international phenomenon could be directly linked to its bold willingness to rank countries. These league tables emerged about the same time as universities first experienced being listed like football clubs. It was an unfamiliar approach, but ranking has spread like ivy over ancient institutions. Everyone stands back and says it's a terrible over-simplification - and then starts planning ways to get higher.Seekers after educational excellence once used to head pilgrim-like towards Finland. This was the most quoted example of a high performing school system, even though in many ways it was a very distinctive and individual system. Scandinavia was the education world's sensible successful neighbour. But Finland has slipped downwards and the gloom has spread across Nordic countries, with Sweden among the biggest fallers. Norway and Denmark are absent from the top end of the tables. Their sluggish performances has been overtaken by countries such as Estonia, Poland and Ireland.The headline results for these tests are about the performance of countries or at least big Chinese regional education systems that are as big as countries, such as Shanghai or Hong Kong.But this year's results show much more local detail. And it often entirely contradicts the national picture. For instance, the education system in the United States has been seen as one of the great under-performers, struggling among the below-average stragglers.Go down to state level and it can be an entirely different story. Massachusetts would be a match for the best European systems. There are similar examples in Italy and Spain. Wales is a long way behind the other parts of the UK.What this means, the OECD says, is that there are often bigger differences within countries than between countries. And if one region can perform so well, why not the rest of the country?Education systems are inextricably linked with economies and the ambitions of their people. And the rising stars are those that are pushing up from below, in Asia, South America and eastern Europe. Vietnam, Brazil are Poland are getting the praise for progress, following in the footsteps of Singapore and South Korea. Baltic states such as Estonia are now more likely to be among the top performers than wealthier western European countries.The great powers of the 20th Century are conspicuous by their absence from the top of these education rankings. The UK, France, Russia, the US, all with very different systems, have collectively shown no sign of a resurgence. They each will have a complicated, entrenched set of legacies. Expect more political introspection and rummaging through the ideas box.Where is this all heading? Economies, employers, digital technologies and media operate globally across international boundaries. But education has until recently remained stubbornly inward looking, with national systems only measured against national exams. Pisa has thrown down a challenge on their credibility. What happens if national exam results are going up when international tests are staying flat? And how can we rely on the accuracy of a sample-based process such as Pisa? More examination of the examinations is lying ahead.", "continent": ""},

Mr Wardak himself became a refugee in Pakistan after the Soviet invasion.There have also been drives against corruption. He said a policy to check teacher proficiency was also a way of detecting so-called \"ghost teachers\", where salaries were being claimed for non-existent staff.This saw about 2,000 names disappearing from the payroll.\"We can't tolerate the stealing of money from innocent children,\" he said.Mr Wardak's campaign for education has been supported by the Global Partnership for Education.This international body, funded by governments including the UK, has allocated $3.25bn (\u00a31.97bn) in the past decade to help improve education in 59 developing countries.Mr Wardak made an impassioned case for the future of Afghanistan's education system.He said the country's long tradition of scholarship had become the \"victim of international wars\" and needed to be restored for a prosperous and peaceful future.\"We are the product of our education, but we forget to pay it back,\" he said.", "continent": ""},

But last time it didn't - the dog didn't bark.What was happening? One clue is the rise that did happen - in self-employment.Figures show an increase of 600,000 in the number of micro-businesses in the UK since the recession began in 2008. One in seven people are now working on their own, for themselves. The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) has identified this as a substantial change in the way we think about work as a whole, and the way that governments think.For decades, lifetime employment by big corporations was the way that most people regarded work. That blueprint may be fading. If it is, then many things may need rethinking - taxes, training, planning permission for home workshops and offices, insurance, and pensions.People who have embraced this self-employed way of life can be lyrical about the possibilities. Tom Hodgkinson, founder of the magazine The Idler, is one of them. He says: \"I would like to see a world where most of us work in small groups and for small companies.\"This is because I know from experience that it is the only responsible path, and that despite the downsides - poverty, long hours, attacks from the spiteful - self-employment can bring happiness and fulfilment.\"Small business offers the potential for creativity and autonomy.\"Emma Jones is another enthusiast - she founded Enterprise Nation in 2005 as a for-profit cheer leader, event organiser and consultancy. She also talks about the huge new freedom of choice available to the self-employed person. How growing children can be fitted into working life. How costs shrink without the need for daily commuting and dressing up for the job. The extra hours available to the home worker.And an array of new tools have helped enormously. Internet telephony makes collaboration easy, even across continents. Internet selling gives small businesses the chance of a global marketplace from day one, if they learn the art of creating a viral buzz. Selling sites such as Etsy provide an international shop window for crafts and antiques, with a low cost entry barrier of 20 US cents (12p). And help is available from professionals in things like website design from services such as Freelancer, where freelance specialists quote for specified jobs almost as soon as the request is posted.The response is international, enabling even a self-employed person to outsource from day one - right across the world. But it has to be said that there may be big drawbacks to this new way of life. The conference on the subject organised earlier this year in London by the RSA began with a glad confident morning of enthusiasm from people who had adopted the self-employed way of life. People like Tom Hodgkinson and Emma Jones.Later in the day, though, things got grimmer. Panels of economic experts raised doubts about the process. They were concerned about the erosion in pay levels when people go self employed, and the uncertainty of it. There were worries that many of the new self-employed were not volunteers seeking a better way of life, but people forced into self-employment by corporate employers finding ways of removing high-cost employees from their payrolls, their pensions, and their responsibilities. Or they were a temporary phenomenon - white collar workers who had lost their company jobs in a recession, and had been forced into self-employed consultancy by sheer necessity.  The director of the publicly-funded innovation powerhouse Nesta, Geoff Mulgan, expressed fears that start-up businesses are not the hotbeds of innovation that many assume. It is still the big companies where most research and development happens. Small start-ups find it very difficult to get the backing to grow and employ others, to become significant contributors to the UK economy as a whole. According to Mr Mulgan one of the big deficits in the modern economy in Britain is the tendency for so many ambitious start-ups to wither on the vine as they attempt to grow fast early in their development. The UK does not seem to have the financial support for this vital phase of growth, unlike the US. The UK doesn't have enough angels and venture capitalists willing to have a punt.Government officials I've met in the past used to refer slightly sneeringly (I felt) to \"lifestyle businesses\", run more for self esteem that powering economic development. That's a technocratic view. I still like the idea that it may be possible to break free of the uniformity of corporate employment through going it alone. For most self-employed people the money may be worse than what they pay on the corporate ladder, but the freedom may be exhilarating.Provided that self-employment is taken seriously by the people who frame the rules and regulations... and by the people who think about what our future society may look like.

They can crunch terabytes of data and take a global, long-term view, spreading your investments across geographies and asset classes, from bonds to equities, index funds to property.Just don't call it \"robo-investing\", says Adam Nash, chief executive of Wealthfront, one of the leading companies in the field, managing more than $1.8bn (\u00a31.2bn) of client assets.\"I've never actually heard a young person refer to robo-investing since I've been here.\" He joined Wealthfront in 2013. \"It seems to be uniformly a term used by older financial advisers to make fun of the new-fangled tech that these kids are using. Expedia is not a robo-travel agent; I don't buy movie tickets on my robot phone.\"He suggests \"automated investment service\" instead. As a former employee of eBay, Apple and LinkedIn, who has a computer science degree from Stanford and a business degree from Harvard, he should know. In fact, many of the people running the companies that are igniting this new generation of personal investing combine advanced software engineering skills with strong business acumen. Inevitably, some are likely to end up as household names and on billionaire lists in the not-too-distant future if they can achieve their ambition of expanding investment to the masses.Jon Stein, the founder and chief executive of Betterment, is another good example. Educated at Columbia Business School and Harvard, he went on to write the initial code for Betterment's website.\"We do everything from end to end,\" he says. \"We do your statements and tax integration; we do all the ACH [Automated Clearing House] transactions; we do the accounting and record keeping. \"We are able to make that process much more efficient and optimised around trading personalised portfolios.\"Betterment says 75% of its clients are under 50. At Wealthfront 60% are under 35. So far, this has mostly been a young person's game. Perhaps that's not surprising, says Mr Nash, considering that the younger generations are much more aware of hidden fees, having seen phone, cable, airline and brokerage companies adopting such \"revenue optimisation\" models. Quite simply, many customers regard these hidden fees as stealing, he says.\"Young people hate the idea of... eight pages of fees that you don't find out about until you are already in the system. \"At Wealthfront we have literally two price points. Under $10,000 is free with no commissions at all, and over $10,000 we charge one quarter of one per cent. It's not like the millionaires are getting a better deal.\"The democratisation of high-quality investment performance is not necessarily new.Low-fee index tracker funds attempt to replicate the performance of particular stock market indexes by copying in full, or in part, the constituent stocks making up that index. If the constituents of the index change, so will your tracker fund - automatically.These tracker funds have produced better returns than almost any human-run fund, net of fees. And that's been proven over decades.The Vanguard Group and its founder John Bogle have been shouting about their not-so-secret sauce for decades. Vanguard spokeswoman Kate Henderson says the general advice for any kind of investment methodology, no matter how old or new, is the same.\"You need to do your homework no matter if you're working with an adviser face to face or a robo-adviser,\" she says. \"Check credentials and references, look at the financial disclosures. Understand where the fees are coming from. Ask the right questions. How is the adviser compensated?\"Vanguard says it has no plans to develop its own fully automated investment platform because its clients are generally older and have more complex portfolios. Such seasoned investors often need a helping human hand when retirement is looming. But to fend off competition from new generation investment companies it introduced Personal Advisor Services in 2013, which offers low-fee advice and tries to mimic what \"robo-investors\" do.Not that Vanguard has any reason to worry. Many of the new automated services buy Vanguard ETF [Exchange Traded Fund] Index products as a core investment within their own portfolios. So Vanguard still dominates the industry, alongside the likes of Fidelity and Schwab.But Wealthfront chief Adam Nash points out there is a huge difference between knowing what you're supposed to do and actually doing it consistently.Only those with the ability, time and willingness to supervise their investments actively would find Wealthfront redundant, which is a tiny percentage of everyday investors, he believes. So he has no qualms about being a relative newcomer to the industry.\"You are talking about 90 million millennials [people coming of age at the turn of the 21st Century] in America. Those businesses with a gold standard are not as shiny as they used to be after the [2008] financial crises. \"I don't think you'll find any survey of millennials that puts the brand of any brokerage or bank particularly high these days. Most of the brands that took decades or even centuries to build are exceptionally tarnished with young people. We are at a unique moment.\"When Jon Stein started Betterment it was out of sheer frustration with his existing brokerage firms who made it complicated to sign up and difficult to navigate through their services. These were financial businesses first and web entities second, he argues. That's why Betterment put a lot of effort into making its website simple to use.\"We have optimised that interface and we know that it helps people stay the course,\" says Mr Stein. \"They make better decisions. For example, we launched a new feature called Tax Impact Preview, which tells you what your taxes will be before you make a transaction. We found that when people see this, 62% of them don't go through with the transaction.\"That suggests that across the sector an awful lot of people are transacting without knowing the full implications of their choices.But the strength of the automated investment idea is also its biggest potential weakness.  Computers and algorithms can keep you on track as long as they know the track you are on.  Deviate from it in any way - a divorce, a new baby - without telling the computer and suddenly your money may be going in a different direction to you.But for an industry still in its infancy the concept is attracting a lot of attention from venture capitalists and consumers. Eventually every financial transaction we make is likely to be monitored in real time with instant advice available at every moment. A frightening or wonderful thought?", "continent": ""},

There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility.Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries.There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries.\"Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,\" he said.\"It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.\"", "continent": ""},

Although city residents complain that it is already horribly overcrowded just over a decade after the first line opened, it is nevertheless an enormous show of infrastructure muscle.Every year millions of commuters travel to and from the city on its six new lines and so avoid the daily gamble of Delhi's notorious traffic jams.And, as any management consultant will tell you, better transport links can add to a country's economic prosperity.Alongside the shiny metro line, the main road to Agra is a rather dowdy affair.Within a few kilometres it rollercoasts its way from slick toll road to passable motorway to rough dual-carriageway to pot-holed and rubble-strewn track.There is, of course, the obligatory wandering ox to negotiate every now and again.Fast, fast, slow, slow. India's economy in physical form.It is an economy in need of reform and Prime Minister Narendra Modi insists he is the man to do it. And with China stumbling and global markets concerned that one Asian engine of growth could be in for a hard landing, can India, now growing faster than China, pick up the reins?Frankly, does it have the muscle to calm world economic jitters?Mr Modi will undertake an official visit to Britain in the autumn to sell the \"Indian dream\".I am told that he quite fancies hiring Wembley Stadium for an event celebrating the generations of Indian immigrants who have made the UK their home.If it goes ahead, it will be similar to Mr Modi's glitzy appearance at Madison Square Garden in New York Stadium events aside, many argue that - if Mr Modi gets the reforms right - the country he leads could economically dominate the next two decades in the way that China's growth story has dominated the last two.Elected last year by a landslide by millions of Indians tired of decades of talk and not enough action, Mr Modi said it was time for a step change in the pace of growth.Stifling bureaucracy, infrastructure projects trapped in endless rows over who, precisely, owns which bits of land, a parliament wracked by political in-fighting and a tax system baffling in its complexity are just some of the problems the country faces.Just over a year after that heady election, the complaints have started - that Mr Modi is not moving quickly enough, that promises remain just that - promises - and that grand plans for land reform and tax changes are bogged down in parliament or even going backwards.The last session of parliament - appropriately called the monsoon session (it rains a lot in Delhi in August) - passed precisely zero pieces of reform legislation despite Mr Modi's efforts.One commentator, Gurcharan Das, the former head of Procter & Gamble in India, said that the country was still a \"hostile place to do business\".And if that is true, essential foreign investment will never flow.I spoke to the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, one of Mr Modi's most powerful allies, and asked him for his response to critics who say the government has disappointed.\"The government has absolute clarity about the direction it has to pursue,\" he said. \"Prime Minister Modi's government almost by the day is continuing to move and reform in the right direction and slowly but surely the results are showing.\"Banking has been reformed to allow more private sector involvement. The defence sector, insurance and real estate have similarly been opened up. Some bureaucratic procedures have been simplified and \"ease of doing business\", Mr Jaitley insists, is improving.He admits, though, that much change is still \"work in progress\" and that India's infrastructure is still \"a far cry\" from the ideal.To encourage in much needed external finance, Mr Jaitley says he will be \"laying out the red carpet\" for foreign investors.Many eyes are now turning to India as China wobbles. Did Mr Jaitley fear that India could be swept up in the global gloom that has struck this week, another emerging economy facing tougher times?\"It had a transient impact,\" Mr Jaitley said of China's stock market turbulence and the decision to allow the renminbi to devalue.\"For instance, when the Chinese economy slowed down a little it had not much impact. When the devaluation and the currency war started we did get somewhat adversely affected. When global markets fell [on Black Monday earlier this week] so we also felt a huge impact in terms of currency and markets.\"But within a day we had recovered.\"I see this as a great opportunity. The Chinese 'normal' has now changed. It is no longer the 9%, 10%, 11% growth rate.\"So the world needs other engines to carry the growth process. And in a slow down environment in the world, an economy which can grow at 8-9% like India certainly has viable shoulders to provide the support to the global economy.\"The head of JCB in India told me that as a net importer of oil and other commodities India was now in a \"sweet spot\".As emerging economies such as Brazil and Russia struggle, reliant as their economies are on commodity exports, India is gaining from the deflationary cycle.\"For us, lower commodity prices and lower oil prices are a boom,'' Mr Jaitley said.\"It is an opportunity and a challenge to Indian politics - if we can continue to reform at a faster pace and really attract global investment, then our ability to provide that shoulder which the world economy needs will be much greater.Mr Jaitley said that the Indian government had already gained a windfall from lower oil prices because it had reduced the need for public subsidies to consumers. That money, he said, was now going to be invested in infrastructure development.India's growth story matters, because, according to Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, India has the potential to become the third largest economy in the world in the next decade.At present it is ninth.With a population of 1.2bn, a figure which is growing more rapidly than China, some estimate that the country will have the largest number of middle class people in the world by 2020.And the higher the number of middle classes people, the higher the level of consumption, which means opportunities for exporters from Britain and around the world.\"The flourishing middle classes creates huge opportunities,\" Ambarish Mitra, an Indian businessman who launched his technology business, Blippar, in the UK and is now exporting it back to India, told me.\"The purchasing power of that middle class is growing. Many people are not going outside of India anymore because so many global companies are setting up shop in India.\"Overall the consumption cycle which makes an economy richer, all the factors are in place [for India]. That is great news for the business community.\"And, even if the government struggles to complete infrastructure projects or reform tax laws, the growth of mobile technology can start doing some of the heavy lifting.\"It is one of the single biggest factors [in the development of the economy],\" Mr Mitra said.\"True empowerment and distribution of knowledge in this day and age comes from connectivity, and connectivity was an issue for the last decade. Now 3G and 4G connectivity is rapidly changing that landscape.\"4G, he said, was now in over 200 cities across India.It is often said that India lives in several centuries at once. The hyper-modern mobile network, the Victorian era railways and of course the cattle in the street, a reminder of India's rural past.Economic growth has sometimes been an uneasy bedfellow to India's history and its loud and often aggressive politics.Mr Modi and Mr Jaitley know they need consensus if they are to lead a government that can harness the country's remarkable history, rather than fight it.And they could also do with completing that motorway from Delhi to Agra, or at least filling in some of the pot-holes.", "continent": ""},
{"media_company": "bbc", "news_topic": "Business", "news_link_url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25304848", "news_date": "8 January 2014", "news_title": "Tackling Uganda's lack of school places", "news_content": "It's always good to have your preconceptions punctured.Uganda, like many sub-Saharan African countries, faces major challenges to build up its education system.At the most fundamental level it has to provide enough places for one of the world's fastest growing populations. There are more Ugandans under the age of 18 than there are adults.So when a new type of award-winning school, supported by an international partnership, is being promoted to fill the gap, what is the great leap forward?Is it the curriculum, the technology, new buildings? What makes it so much better?A senior teacher in Kiira View secondary school, near the town of Jinja, says the best thing about the school is that staff get paid on time.It's such a simple but important point. What is called \"teacher absenteeism\" is a major barrier.When teachers fail to get their salaries, or don't earn enough, they take second or third jobs to pay the bills. And it means no-one is there to teach the children.It's encapsulated in the pages of a local newspaper. On the front page is a big story about pupils taking national exams and how significant it will be for their future. It shows a country that really values education, where children will walk for miles under the equatorial sun to study.Open the next page and there's a threat of strike action by teachers still waiting for last month's pay cheques.The World Bank also emphasises the importance of such basic administration. Last month it published a report commending Uganda's progress in widening access to school, but warned it was being undermined by poor school management.It reported that teacher absenteeism, whatever the cause, meant that \"40% of public school classrooms did not have a teacher teaching in them\".These are not the type of issues that appear in the education speeches of global leaders, but here, at the end of a dirt road not far from the source of River Nile, it's what counts.Kiira View is part of an experiment to change how some of Uganda's schools are managed, with a growing number becoming private-public partnerships.A social enterprise called Promoting Equality in African Schools (PEAS) is an important part of this, running an expanding network of schools that aims to raise standards and ensure that schools are managed properly and transparently.The Ugandan government contributes part of the funding and the PEAS network, with headquarters in the UK, monitors the educational quality, efficiency and accountability of the schools.It already operates 21 schools in Uganda and the charity's Kampala-based managing director Susan Opok says they aim to expand to 100 schools.The project won a prestigious award this autumn at the annual WISE international education summit in Qatar.The WISE awards are designed to \"showcase and promote innovative educational projects\" - and it commended the PEAS scheme for delivering high-quality school places at low cost and for developing the public-private partnership with the Ugandan government.The particular challenge being addressed by PEAS schools is Uganda's lack of secondary level places. The country has been successful in enrolling more than 90% of children in primary school. But only about a quarter of young people remain in secondary school. This is a huge bottleneck for any ambitions to improve the job opportunities for young people or to think about expanding higher education.It traps people in very visible poverty. In and around Kampala are sprawling encampments of makeshift huts, assembled from wood, earth or scrap materials, and occupied by millions of people. It's rare that the word \"slum\" should seem like a cosy understatement.The PEAS schools want to provide more good quality secondary places for poor families in the places they are most needed.A key difference is the concept of creating schools that will be self-sustaining into the future. The charity's founder, John Rendel, says he wants support from the UK to be no longer necessary after 2021.As well as creating more places, PEAS provides a structured, systematic approach to standards and the curriculum, which will be able to be replicated. It makes improving the quality of teaching a cornerstone.It's not without controversy, because PEAS schools charge parents a small fee. The argument is that this money, along with the government payments, will give the school a viable independent financial future. It means teachers get paid.It also prevents schools from becoming short-lived show projects. In a country desperate for school places, PEAS is planning to take over 25 schools that are lying unused. Creating schools is not really about opening buildings.But any level of fee has been seen as a deterrent for taking up school places, in reports by Unesco.\"It's a very big sacrifice,\" says Ms Opok, for parents who are poor and illiterate.It's also controversial for the Ugandan government to hand over state funding for schools to be run by private providers.But an education ministry official in Kampala says that the reality is that the state sector does not have the capacity to provide all the places needed.The government views PEAS as \"good partners\" and expects to see the network expanding.Many of the challenges facing schools are really about wider, non-educational questions of infrastructure.Teachers and pupils in Kiira View mention the huge need for computers, but the school does not have access to mains electricity. An affordable, reliable electricity supply could be the biggest innovation for education.The World Bank education report highlights how many schools lack basic equipment such as text books.But there's no shortage of energy or ambition among the children. In spartan classrooms, they describe what they want for their future. There are would-be doctors, lawyers and engineers. They have been taking O-levels to decide how much that will be possible, with exam papers driven by motorbike to the local police station for safekeeping.The school, with its neat hedges and tended lawns, goats and chickens, is an island of optimism.And it would be hard to overstate the importance for Uganda of strengthening its education system.In every rural village on every suspension-busting potholed road, there is an extraordinary hive of human activity. There are people trading, selling and making. Gravity-defying stacks of fruit are carried from lush fields on bikes. Churches and mosques seem to be on every corner. It's as intense as the country's bright red earth.Millions of rural people have migrated to the cities, looking for work. And in Kampala it feels like most of them are trying to ride a motorbike taxi through the city centre at the same time.Many end up in the vast, ramshackle slums. But it's not a one-sided picture. From what looks like apocalyptic poverty, a young man steps out immaculately dressed in a suit and tie, emerging from chaos without a crease.There are young women who seem to be heading to work in the type of floral dresses that wouldn't look out of place in a 1950s Women's Institute meeting.Uganda's economy, forecast to grow at 6.5% next year, is attracting investment, not least the visible presence of Chinese firms. How will local people share in this growing economic wealth?With tens of millions of extra young people, this could either be a story of a young confident country with growing affluence and higher-quality education.

They can compartmentalise their lives and go off without a care in the world. But for the rest of us, it's not that simple. We experience a lot of seepage between the walls of work and life.  Holiday worry is just one of those leakages. And you're not going to get much sympathy worrying about your holidays, because you don't occupy the high moral ground. The high moral ground is where the people who are not currently on their holidays go when you are on yours. The first question is when to go. For years, when to go was dictated by the most important document on any company's computer system - the holiday spreadsheet. In a lot of offices, the spreadsheet has been superseded by a super-duper \"Absence Management Software\", which is just \"one module in a holistic and fully integrated-across-all-verticals system\". But there are still holiday spreadsheets \"currently locked by another user\" lurking in offices around the world. Holiday worriers are at a disadvantage here as their reticence means they haven't got in early before their colleagues take the prize slots. The holiday spreadsheet is the flight before the flight. If you're not on it, you're going nowhere. In the political office, in the northern hemisphere, August is the month where most politicians take their holidays, except one or two. Those are the ones you see being forced to defend the government across a wide range of topics and very much out of their comfort zone. They are living proof of the dangers of procrastination in getting the cells next to your name highlighted in green on the holidays spreadsheet. Here in Ireland, one government minister has been dubbed the \"Minister for August\" so ever-present has he been on air.Ideally you should have done a comprehensive skills handover that should have the effect of broadening the skills base of your company - thereby improving resilience in the long term. But you haven't. The rule of holidays is that the likelihood of some storm developing increases as you near your departure date. By the time you've dealt with that there's barely enough time to scribble down your password and write your out-of-the-office reply.  At the very least spell-check this, and don't write it with any device with an aggressive autocorrect function - the last thing want to do is tell people you are \"out of the orifice\". And change your passwords to something that isn't obscene or a slight against a colleague. You don't know when you might have to dictate it loudly down the phone to your handover.Who do you hand over to? The most important character trait in the person who's dealing with your mess? Loyalty. Someone who'll refrain from complete character assassination until you get back and then greet you with \"you owe me bigtime.\"No wonder so many people head off with a nagging feeling that here are some loose ends. Recent books on happiness have recognised this and suggest doing a little bit of work in the morning even while on holidays. It mightn't be every morning, you could check a few emails early on for looming crises. You won't be able to fix it but you can obfuscate any group email chains that have the potential to turn into \"Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Problem\" by emailing individual people on the side or editing the subject from Problem to Opportunity. Or just some token heroism might be enough. Token heroism is where you let it be known that you can be contacted if there's an emergency, yes even on your holidays! But then you render it almost unusable by dipping it in passive aggression. Take one phone call, arrange to have your spouse whisper audibly in the background to children - imaginary or otherwise: \"In a minute darlings, this is clearly more important than family.\"Or you could just go somewhere with no connectivity apart from a coin-operated computer in the lobby. It's amazing how efficient you get when you have exactly three minutes, 15 seconds to put out a fire. Of course, a flipside to this worry is that your workplace can get on too well without you. In which case you may need to worry whether they need you at all. You might as well forget about that and enjoy your last paid holiday. Having resolved your departure-related worries it's time to move onto the other anxieties that holidays bring - fear of coming back. To ease the transition, don't provoke your colleagues with photos of your holidays while you are still on holiday.The standard photo is one of the holiday-maker's feet - the \"toe-tograph\" - with a colourful drink to one side and azure waters in the distance. Speaking of filters, these toe-tos are often overlaid with a filter to make the photo look like it was taken in the saturate colour of our childhood. Which is ironic because in our childhood we weren't kite-surfing in Koh Samui, we were sitting on a gravelly beach eating bread and cheese sandwiches, protecting them from the attacks of an angry gull. Once you're back you need to get in early. If nothing else then to take the hundreds-of-unread-emails look off your face, but also to prepare your reply to repeated questions about how your holiday was. Here's a tip - don't make yourself sad by dwelling on that which has past. No one really wants to know how your holiday was, they just want to remind you of its end. Go with it, your reply should acknowledge this. \"It was great - back now though. (Hollow laugh)\"All of this worry is going to exhaust you. But don't worry, your boss is off next week - and then you can truly relax. ", "continent": ""},

In a speech at the , Nicola Sturgeon said BBC Scotland should be given more influence and a greater slice of the licence fee.And she called for a new BBC Scotland TV channel to be created alongside a second English-language radio station.Ms Sturgeon also said the corporation had not been institutionally biased during the independence referendum.But she said there had been \"occasions when its coverage - through oversight, apparent ignorance of the detail of an issue or as a result of simply following the agenda of openly partisan print media - lapsed from the objective output the referendum deserved into what could seem partial and, at times, pejorative.\"The first minister argued that the old model of public broadcasting no longer reflected the \"varied and rich political and social realities of the UK\", and that the BBC Charter renewal process presented an opportunity for bold change.The BBC is expected to publish its own proposals for Charter renewal in the next fortnight. The next Charter will form the basis for BBC operations over the next decade.Speaking as she became the first politician to deliver the Alternative MacTaggart Lecture, Ms Sturgeon called for the BBC to adopt a federal structure, with a separate board for each home nation under a UK-wide board.And she repeated the SNP's calls for broadcasting in Scotland to be devolved from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament, but stressed it was \"vital\" that the BBC continued to have editorial independence. Ms Sturgeon said that a new and distinct BBC Scotland TV channel would be the best way of ensuring a \"wider, richer\" range of content was available to viewers in Scotland.She added: \"Radio Scotland currently has an almost impossible job - it's one station trying to reflect the life of an entire nation. And it does it well. \"But a second English-language radio service would provide a greater variety of programmes. And because the two channels could specialise more than Radio Scotland does, they would have stronger and more distinct identities.\"Ms Sturgeon argued that the UK had changed dramatically since devolution, but broadcasters were still catching up with its consequences.And although that posed questions for all public service broadcasters, the issue was perhaps most acute with the BBC, she said.The first minister added: \"Scotland, the BBC and all the nations and regions of the UK have the right to expect something truly radical from the charter review. A tight financial settlement cannot be a reason not to do things differently.\"A BBC that puts forward a bold proposal for Scotland, for the nations and regions, and for the UK, will have in us a strong and willing ally. A BBC that offers piecemeal solutions will fail to meet the demands or restore the trust of Scottish audiences.\"Ms Sturgeon's SNP won 56 out of the 59 seats in Scotland in May's election. Its manifesto argued Scotland should receive an extra \u00a3100m in BBC funding to \"more accurately reflect licence fee revenue raised in Scotland\".The BBC said it recognised a demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on BBC services.A spokesman said: \"Audiences across Scotland get great value from the licence fee, and are some of the highest users of BBC services.\"The licence fee funds much loved services across the UK - like BBC One and Radio Two - but also specific services like Radio Scotland and BBC Alba. Services for smaller audiences clearly cost more to provide, and that is why we spend more in the nations per head than the rest of the UK.\"We look forward to working with the Scottish government on these issues, and to consulting with licence fee payers in Scotland about how they would like to see their licence fee spent.\"Ms Sturgeon's speech was heavily criticised by opposition parties. Liz Smith, culture spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \"Instead of focusing on much-loved programmes like Strictly or Eastenders, the SNP's vision for the BBC is for millions of pounds of licence fee funds to be diverted to pay for as yet unspecified programmes which accord with the SNP's national story.\"Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"Apart from the conspiracy theorists in the SNP, people value the broadcaster which is seen as an oracle of impartiality across the world.\"Scottish Labour's democracy spokeswoman, Claire Baker, said: \"If we want to be truly bold and radical then we need to look at the challenges facing the BBC in the years ahead. \"This is not the creation of new 'Scottish only' stations but rather how BBC content is viewed and shared and how the corporation stays relevant in a time of smartphones, streaming and social media.\"", "continent": ""},

It was during a particularly rosy era for the brand, whose sales by 2002 would more than triple to $13.8bn (\u00a38.8bn) annually. \"Jeans popping in every mall and town and city,\" LL Cool J rapped in the TV spot, referencing the retailer's hugely popular denim offerings.At the end, he closed with: \"How easy is this? Fall into the Gap.\" But easy street has been hard for Gap to find recently.Management missteps, a strong US dollar and lacklustre designs have hurt the once-dominant retailer, as has competition from fast-fashion brands.Rivals such as H&M and Forever 21 offer a wider array of styles at lower prices. Gap shops' July sales numbers reflect these challenges, with same-shop sales falling 7%. Comparable sales for Banana Republic, a sister brand in Gap Inc's portfolio, fell 10% in the same period. Old Navy, the most affordable and currently most successful Gap Inc brand, showed 3% growth.\"None of us are happy with the performance now,\" Gap chief executive Art Peck told shareholders at the company's annual investor meeting in June, a day after announcing about , most of them in the next fiscal year. About  are also on the chopping block. \"I hate closing stores,\" Mr Peck said , but called the downsizing \"overdue\" and \"the right thing to do\". This sober news would have been unthinkable during the 1990s, when the brand was so popular Sharon Stone wore a simple Gap shirt with a designer skirt to the Oscars - twice.At that time, I was growing up a state away from the company's California HQ and experienced the Gap frenzy firsthand.In my eight-to-10-year-old mind, there was no better clothes shop, and most of my friends agreed.What I considered the best parts of my mid-to-late-90s wardrobe were from Gap; green velvet dungarees, purple jelly sandals and a maroon fleece pullover I wore until the fabric pilled.Though Gap's earlier success was built on simple staples such as khakis and T-shirts, today's customers are more likely to want to stand out.\"Uniformity is no longer cool,\" said Simeon Siegel, a senior retail analyst at Nomura Securities. \"The trick now is convincing your customer that they're getting something unique.\"Consumers also have more demands on their dollar than buyers past. Besides fast fashion, accessories, online retailers and so-called \"\" wear have all taken money and attention away from iconic American mall-based brands.It also doesn't help that Gap has grappled with its own aesthetic in recent years, struggling to rapidly and consistently deliver styles consumers want. Gap spokeswoman, Kari Shellhorn told the BBC \"Of top priority is delivering more consistent and compelling product collections.\"Dana Telsey, the chief research officer at Telsey Advisory Group, said Gap's products needed work.\"Whether it's colour or print or it's pattern, the Gap brand hasn't been kept up to date,\" Ms Telsey said.This was evident on a recent weeknight trip to a Gap shop in Herald Square, a Manhattan shopping hub.Once inside, I was met with a display of the brand's signature solid coloured T-shirts and tops. They appeared unchanged from the Gap inventory I remember seeing as a child. When I visited, the shop had few customers.Of those, I noticed that most of them were older than the 25- to 35-year-old target customer that Gap global president Jeff Kirwan described at the shareholder meeting in June.The biggest crowd in sight were the eight women combing intently through racks of the sale section, stuffed with inventory. I asked my former flatmate, a Gap devotee, about this.\"I can't even remember the last time I bought anything full price at Gap,\" she said. \"Probably never.\"Dana Telsey, of the Telsey Advisory Group, said she had noticed the abundant markdowns at Gap in her regular shop visits.\"Until they have their product right, I think we'll continue to see them have promotions,\" Ms Telsey said.Next, for the sake of comparison, I visited the flagship H&M across the street, which opened in May. A bass-heavy soundtrack and dancing security guard greeted me.The shop was teeming with brightly patterned clothing and young people who seemed eager to buy. Upstairs, the queue to the dressing room was so long that some customers were turning away to avoid the wait.The contrast highlights how urgently .Gap executives have told investors not to expect their turnaround plan to take hold until after the holidays.As Mr Peck said earlier this year, spring 2016 will be \"a no-excuses moment\".", "continent": ""},

What's his secret? Is the way to win at sprinting to move your legs faster than your rivals do?Since the Beijing Olympics in 2008 Bolt has won every race he's entered at a World Championship or the Olympics, with the exception of one, where he was disqualified for making a false start.When non-athletes want to run fast they set about moving their legs as fast as they can, so you might assume that Bolt has achieved this exceptional record by making his legs move faster than everyone else has. But this idea doesn't stand up - in fact, it falls flat on its face.\"Elite sprinters don't swing their legs any faster than recreational runners,\" says Dr Sam Allen of Loughborough University.Instead, the difference is that a top sprinter takes longer and more powerful strides.Research shows that an amateur runner often takes between 50 and 55 steps to complete 100m, while an elite sprinter takes in the region of 45.\"Elite athletes generate so much more power, owing to the fact they naturally have more fast-twitch muscle fibres. These elite athletes therefore spend a lot less time on the ground which results in them being propelled forward much quicker,\" says Allen.Studies led by the American based researcher Peter Weyand have found that at top speed an elite sprinter's foot will typically spend 0.08 seconds in contact with the ground at the beginning of each stride . Sam Allen says the fastest sprinters seem to be spend about 60% of the time in the air, with no foot on the ground, while for amateur athletes it's more like 50%.But even among top sprinters, Bolt stands out, and this is partly because of his height.\"Bolt is a genetic freak because being 6ft 5ins tall means he shouldn't be able to accelerate at the speed he does given the length of his legs,\" says former Great Britain sprinter Craig Pickering.\"At the beginning of a race you want to take short steps in order to accelerate, but because he's so tall he can't do that. But then when he reaches top speed he has a massive advantage over everyone else because he's taking far fewer steps.\"Bolt typically completes a 100m race in about 41 steps - three or four fewer than his rivals.\"Stride length is the biggest determent between a good sprinter who's able to run under 10 seconds [in the 100m] and those sprinters who can't,\" Pickering says.Although good training can help all budding athletes be faster than they are, says Sam Allen, \"the best sprinters will always benefit from having a huge amount of natural ability\".It all depends on what nature allows us to do with our legs once they make contact with ground.", "continent": ""},

Forgotten Tina? The acronym for There Is No Alternative? Regularly cited by Margaret Thatcher? Thatcher? Oh, come on, it hasn't been that long since the Tories were in sole command of the UK.  Sole but not unalloyed because, of course, we now have devolved administrations including the one led by the SNP at Holyrood.    I thought of Tina as I scrutinised George Osborne's delivery of his budget statement. The reminiscence first surfaced as I noted the series of reactions from Mr Osborne's Cabinet colleagues.  The transport secretary looked magisterially content as the Chancellor talked of spending more on roads. The defence secretary looked suitably resolute as the Chancellor promised more money for the military and security services.  The work and pensions secretary looked positively ecstatic, punching the air like a tennis player who has just served an ace. This in response to the announcement of a National Living Wage, applicable to all aged over 25 and mandatory for employers.  And the prime minister? Supportive throughout, of course, but with a beatific grin upon his features when Mr Osborne talked of the biggest sale of state assets (albeit formerly private banks) since 1987.  Ah, 1987. Even across the airwaves, one could sense the nostalgia palpably washing over the PM. Just a year before Mr Cameron joined the Conservative Research Department. The Thatcher era. The time of Tina.  But this is about more than mere nostalgia. George Osborne set out quite deliberately in a range of ways to suggest that there is no effective or realistic alternative to his approach.  He sought to present his proposals as driven by arithmetical logic rather than political choice.  He went further, explicitly adapting policies from rival parties - such as the living wage and curbs on non-dom tax rules. Further still, seeking to place his plan - somewhat ambitiously - within the context of far-reaching reforms such as the Factory Acts and female suffrage.  And yet further, attempting to recruit those self-same rivals to a plan to oblige the UK government, of whatever colour, to maintain a budgetary surplus unless the economy slumps to a defined low rate.  All part, to emphasise, of an endeavour by the Chancellor to suggest that Tina is alive and thriving, perhaps seeking non-subsidised accommodation in the yet-to-be-realised Northern Powerhouse.  This pitch, of course, is not primarily aimed at the rival parties - although it purports to be. It is aimed over their heads at the voters. Mr Osborne is seeking to suggest that there is a remorseless logic to his package, that only the ingrate or innumerate would oppose it.  His delivery was an intriguing blend. At times, there was a philosophical edge as he expounded upon the need to make work pay and to reduce the reliance upon welfare as an end in itself.  On other occasions, he seemed more like a stand-up who has been on the circuit for a while and whose soundbites draw instant recognition. \"We are all in this together.\" \"Britain is open for business\". His fans had heard them before, of course they had, but their very familiarity provoked pleasure.  This aim of suggesting the intrinsic inevitability of his plans is designed to make voters swallow elements they might otherwise find distinctly unpalatable. You don't like welfare cuts, eh? But how about that living wage? Not happy with that cut in corporation tax? How about if I take you out of paying income tax altogether?  Did it work with the opposition parties? Of course not. Indeed, the chamber seemed notably restless with angry interventions from sedentary positions drawing repeated rebukes from the chair.  The SNP's Stewart Hosie dissected the plans in some detail while concluding that the Chancellor was \"taking from the poor, giving to the rich\", and adding: \"The Tories have done it again.\"  Labour reckoned the budget was a hand up for inherited wealth allied to a slapdown for the poor, most notably through welfare cuts.  The Greens summed up the package as \"an attack on the vulnerable\".  The Liberal Democrats said the budget proved the \"nasty party\" was back. For the avoidance of doubt, they meant their former coalition colleagues. There is more to come. Further departmental spending cuts to add to the welfare constraint. Those cuts will feed through to Scotland via the Barnett Formula. Protecting NHS spending, as the Chancellor pledged, should help Scotland, arithmetically. Mr Hosie warned that cuts in educational support in England might also feed through negatively to Scotland.There was a clear indication of future Tory strategy towards Scotland. Rather than work in progress, Mr Osborne depicted the new powers for Holyrood as a done deal, challenging the SNP: \"You've got the powers, when are you going to use them?\" The SNP argue that the powers package is far from settled, that there is more Westminster scrutiny to come - and much more discussion with the Scottish government. Further, they argue that the final scope of the deal depends upon the fiscal framework currently being negotiated between themselves and the Treasury. More on that, much more.    But right now, following this budget, there are calculations to be made. Employers need to work out how they cope with the changes in tax - and, particularly, the move towards a mandatory living wage. Families reliant upon benefits will be anxiously reviewing their household finances.And then the political calculations. Will more favour the tax cuts and living wage than deplore the cuts in benefit? For the Chancellor, presented with endless sums as he finalises his plan, that is perhaps the most salient calculation of all.    ", "continent": ""},

Fifty-eight years later, that proposition is the promise of the 21st Century automobile.The self-driving car has long been the stuff of science fiction. Now it may soon be here, on the streets of Britain and other places.The British government is interested, and putting money into the proposition. Three consortia of consultants companies and universities are revving up trials in places such as Greenwich, Bristol, Coventry and Milton Keynes. But they have some catching up to do. For the past six years, Google cars have been cruising the roads and streets of California and Texas with a human driver ready to take over from the autonomous machine in an emergency. They have racked up more than one million miles of autonomous experience, 14 accidents (mainly being rear-ended by distracted drivers), and vast amounts of data about this sort of transport. To outsiders it appears as if Google has cracked the future of car, and even parked one of the first prototypes in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Silicon Valley, California. I sat in it (static) last summer.   Autonomous vehicles do indeed have huge potential. In theory taking human beings out of the driver's seat altogether could cut accidents to close to zero.  People who cannot drive for some reason could use car transport.  They could vastly increase the density of road use, eliminate looking for parking spaces, and then do the tricky business of parking. They could hugely reduce the cost of road transport by replacing truck drivers with computer power. They could turn our roads into great channels of schematised connectivity with vehicles moving close together in a similar way to how information moves along the Internet's fibre optic \"pipes\". IT specialists are always frustrated with the random chaos of roads and motorways, now - they think - road transport is ripe for true digitalisation.  That is the vision. . And many different groups of people are working on it.One of the most eye-catching schemes in Britain is in Milton Keynes, where the Autodrive Project wants to deploy a collection of small autonomous electric pods. Arrive at the railways station, step into a two-person pod, say where you want to go (in a limited town centre range of addresses) using your smart phone, and off you drive. The pods are designed to use the ample pavements of Milton Keynes, not the roads where autonomous vehicles are not permitted by law. The trouble is, to use powered vehicles on pavements is going to need a change in the regulations, too. This is nothing like the drive-anywhere experience promised by the enthusiasts. It's a reminder of the Segway dilemma in Britain, imposing severe legal restrictions on a mode of personal transport heralded as revolutionary when it was introduced in 2001. Illegal to ride a motor vehicle on the pavements, illegal on the roads too. No doubt the legal problems will be resolved for the pods.The pods are part of the great familiarisation process that will be needed to make autonomous driving acceptable - not just to the users inside but to the people on the roads and pavements who encounter them. It's a question of trust. What laws have to change to make this possible? What local regulations? What is the role of insurance companies in a transport world where (theoretically) the chance of accidents is reduced to almost zero by the intelligence of the computer driver?And (big question) who has the best chance of creating a really autonomous vehicle? Existing car manufacturers or the tech upstarts trying to break into the market - people such as Google or Tesla with little or no prior investment in the internal combustion engine?  Looked at objectively, it will probably take a long time for full scale A-B self-driving cars to become the norm. And mingling autonomous cars with human drivers is going to be very tricky.  So look out first for self-driving trucks doing routine drives between depots, cutting the cost of lorry transport by 80% if the human driver can be eliminated.An autonomous trial being pioneered by Volvo in Gothenberg in Sweden in 2017 gives me another vivid glimpse of the future. These cars will not go everywhere for years. But it may be relatively easy to tackle the main part of the commuting journey - the bit in the middle.A human driver will take the car to the motorway. Then the car itself takes over allowing the commuter to read, sleep or prepare for the working day ahead. Get close to the chaotic city, and the car will hand back to the driver - or pull in safely and wait for him or her to take over. Meanwhile, ordinary cars are becoming a little bit autonomous piece by piece, from cruise control to assisted parking to collision warnings. They are heading towards being computers with wheels attached. It will be decades before self-driving cars are the norm, but the bits and pieces that make them almost viable could creep up on us almost unawares - with lower insurance premiums, they say.

There are claims against the methodology of the testing and more widely there are warnings against too much being read into the results.Among the concerns are that political pressure to boost international rankings will force education systems to become more narrowly focused on these measures.", "continent": ""},

Tunisia was the only African country that participated.The top places in the rankings are dominated by Asian school systems - although China so far does not participate as a whole country, but is represented by high-performing cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong.In the next set of Pisa tests it is expected that a wider range of provinces in China will be entered.Shanghai's maths score is the equivalent of three years' schooling above the OECD average.Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan are among the highest ranked across all subjects.The OECD's Andreas Schleicher, in charge of the Pisa tests, has highlighted Vietnam's \"star performance\".The South East Asian country has entered the top 10 for science and outperformed many much wealthier western education systems, including the United States.The  and remains among the average, middle-ranking countries, in 26th place for maths and 23rd for reading, broadly similar to three years ago.But the UK has slipped in science from 16th to 21st place.Although not directly comparable, because there have been different numbers of countries taking part, this marks a sustained decline, with the UK having ranked 4th in the tests taken in 2000.Much of this falling behind has been caused by other countries improving more quickly.The OECD figures show that there has been almost no change in the UK's test scores, with the results \"flat lining\".Within the UK,  in maths and reading, with England higher for science. Northern Ireland is behind them both across all subjects.But the , adrift from most of the middle ranking western countries.The lowest ranked countries in this international league table are Peru and Indonesia. The OECD says the gap between top and bottom of this global classroom is the equivalent of six years of learning.However Indonesia also appears as the country where the highest proportion of children say they are happiest at school. And the least happy pupils are in high-performing South Korea.Finland, once an education superpower at the top of the rankings, has slipped downwards. Along with Sweden, Finland had the biggest fall in scores of any country in maths tests.Sweden has fallen behind eastern and central European countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Estonia. But Finland still has the highest position of any European country, fifth in science, the only non-Asian country in any of the top fives.Among the strongest performances by English-speaking countries are Ireland, ranked 7th in reading, and Canada ranked 10th in science.Chile is the strongest performer among South American countries, above the lowest-performing European country, Albania.These Pisa tests provide an increasing level of regional detail and they show the huge variation within a single country.In Italy, the region of Trento is one of the best in the world at maths, but Calabria is far below many European countries, the equivalent of two years behind.The US remains average or below average, below countries such as Russia and Spain, but individual states are high performers.If Massachusetts was ranked as a country it would be sixth best in the world, ahead of any European country.From a low base in previous years, one of the biggest improvers in maths and reading is Qatar, a country that has been a high-profile investor in education.Katja Hall, the chief policy director of the CBI employers' organisation, said: \"No issue matters more to the UK economy over the long term than the quality of our education system.\"But she warned the results should be a \"wake-up call\" and that when UK schools are only \"treading water\" that the country's economic performance will suffer.\"High-performing schools are the best way to support economic growth and greater opportunity.\"The OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurria, launching the results in Washington in the US, said: \"It's more urgent than ever that young people learn the skills they need to succeed.\"In a global economy, competitiveness and future job prospects will depend on what people can do with what they know.

Conservationists warn that the growth in the illegal ivory trade means elephants could be wiped out in parts of Africa in the next few years. As demand from China pushes levels of poaching and smuggling to new highs, we investigate China's illegal ivory traders.In a nondescript shopping mall in Beijing sellers offering antiques and artworks are crammed together. The shops are piled high with stone carvings, jade and ivory. Some have whole elephant tusks on display, others ivory figures, statues and intricately worked scenes.As soon as we enter one shop with cabinet after cabinet of carvings, the owner gets tense and defensive. \"We have a licence. We have a legal licence to sell ivory. It's hanging there,\" he says pointing to the wall.China has around 150 legal, government-licensed ivory shops. This is one of them. They are the only places allowed to sell ivory to individual buyers. The government says ivory carving is an ancient art it wants to keep alive. Chinese consumers, increasingly wealthy, desire ivory. Some think it is lucky, while for some it is a way to display their status. Others see it as a good investment and many give ivory as a gift or bribe to win favour with an official or business contact. It is certainly good business.\"I've been in this business more than 40 years. I don't get involved in anything illegal,\" says the shopkeeper. When we ask why he's so worried, he says: \"There are illegal shops. But it's a case of 'one rotten egg spoiling the whole soup'.\"China's government was given permission to import one consignment of more than 60 tonnes of ivory from Africa six years ago. Pieces carved from that legal stockpile can be sold in China as long as they have a driving-licence-sized photo identification. But when we look closely at the pictures on the photo IDs in the shop we are in, the images do not quite match the carvings on sale. When we ask about the discrepancy the shopkeeper tells us it is time to leave.\"It's just a matter of the angle the picture is taken from. You shouldn't make a fuss about it,\" he says, adding: \"I'm off. I'm closing now. I told you. It's an angle problem.\"It is a common scam. Reusing old IDs to sell new pieces of ivory can be a way of laundering ivory that is not from the legal stockpile but illegal, smuggled into China.Last month Chinese customs officers destroyed six tonnes of seized ivory. It was a signal that China is trying to tackle the problem. Watching the event, John Scanlon, secretary general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), the body regulating the international trade in endangered species, told reporters Africa's elephants were increasingly threatened.\"In 2011, we had 25,000 elephants illegally killed on the African continent. Last year, it was 22,000. So that was almost 50,000 elephants illegally killed for their ivory in just two years. This is decimating the African elephant population and we will soon see local extinctions in some areas, in particular within Central Africa.\"To evade the current crackdown China's ivory traders are moving online. Selling ivory on the internet is illegal and major websites have banned it. But on sites specialising in auctions, antiques and collectables it is easy to find dozens of photos of ivory pieces for sale. We made contact with one trader. He met us in a Beijing hotel. \"People I know who specialise in this trade are already in jail. This business is banned in China,\" he said. \"We have a new police chief in Beijing. They have started to monitor it very strictly.\"He told us it was getting harder to import and move ivory. Taking it on trains or even the subway was impossible as all bags had to go through airport-style security. Sending it by courier was risky too, he said, and even ivory being moved in bags on public buses had been seized. Once he was convinced we were genuine buyers he produced a large tusk. He said it was smuggled ivory, 57cm (22 inches) long, weighing 2.7kg (6 pounds), the asking price 77,000 Chinese yuan ($12,700; \u00a37,600).The trader insisted this was some of the best quality ivory available, taken from an elephant not long after it had been killed, and carved with mythical figures. \"Here on top there's a phoenix, here a dragon,\" he said. \"There are different types of ivory, white, yellow and blood ivory. This is close to blood ivory. It's the best.\"And, he added, the crackdowns themselves are pushing up the price of ivory, making it even more attractive to investors and more profitable for sellers.\"There are lots of ivory collectors. But there's less and less ivory available. So the price is shooting up every day,\" our seller told us.He left with his tusk and has since been in contact, apparently keen to make a sale. Demand from China is a major factor in the surge in poaching and smuggling. Some believe the answer is a total ban on ivory sales. China does not want that. But while the buying goes on, so does the killing, pushing elephants in parts of Africa towards extinction.", "continent": ""},

He said he had a slight sense that people who rushed to defend the BBC were \"trying to have an argument that's never been started\".\"Whatever my view is, I don't determine what programmes the BBC should show,\" he added. \"That's the job of the BBC.\"Mr Whittingdale said any speculation that the Conservative Party had always wanted to change the BBC due to issues such as its editorial line was \"absolute nonsense\".", "continent": ""},

The City of London has changed beyond recognition. Not just the way it looks and the space it occupies - it now includes the Docklands - but also the way it behaves. When I started bicycling round the City in 1975, the Bank of England insisted that all banks in London's financial district had to be within 10 minutes' walking distance of the governor's office. This was done, it was said, so that in times of crisis he could summon bosses of the banks to his parlour with half an hour's notice. Thus the governor could rule the City merely by raising his eyebrows, in that celebrated phrase, face to face. Bank governance was done deftly, behind the scenes.The governor never spoke in public, thus preserving his mystery. It was only in the 1980s, when the Bank relaxed that 10-minute rule, that it was possible for Canary Wharf to become a permissible place to base London banks.And with Big Bang in October 1986, everything changed.Overnight, the old London Stock Exchange monopoly of the gentlemanly partnership brokers and jobbers was officially abolished. The brokers sold out to incoming hordes of banks.The move created the equivalent, it was said, of 1,500 millionaires as the partners sold their interests to the bankers and retired to their country rectories.The ethos of the City of London was changing rapidly, giving new powers to the regulators, as opposed to the all-seeing eyes of the Bank's governor. The City of London flourished as thousands of new jobs sprouted on the new dealing floors and financial services became a boom industry. Canary Wharf's newly erected towers became not overspill back offices, but vital contributors to the economy. There was no room in the old Mediaeval City for many buildings with sufficient floor space for the huge, open-plan dealing rooms that were never needed in the old partnership days. Foreign banks flocked to the City, and Britain's banks felt they had to participate in the rush into universal banking that became evident all around.They had, after all, been huge. Midland Bank was the biggest bank in the world for decades, but a conventional one, with millions of retail customers and thousands of business clients served by hundreds of local branches.A major new problem was the cultural gap between the natural caution of the trained banker and the huge appetite for risk of the new breed of traders created by the influx into investment banking. For generations, the High Street banks were on the whole run by traditional bankers brought up through the ranks, who had no gut feeling for what the traders were doing and may not have understood it. Often the overall bosses, chairmen and chief general managers, as chief executives of banks used to be called, were paid far less than the bonus boys on the trading floor. Bonuses were another curiosity of the new City of London. In the old partnership world, profits were divvied up at the end of the financial year, as the partners shared the rewards of their stewardship. In bad years no payouts, in good years bonanzas. The post-Big Bang City in the 1980s replicated this reward structure in order to motivate its adrenaline-fired staffers, but without the downside.They shared only in the putative profits.Back at the Bank of England, that old regime of regulation by gubernatorial nods and winks could no longer function in the post-Big Bang world, when so many of the participants were international players who did not respect or even understand familiar, gentlemanly City concepts such as the Stock Exchange motto My Word is My Bond.  As a great participant in the burgeoning global financial markets, London needed regulation, not the self-governance of a kind that had ruled the City for 200 or 300 years. Enter the official regulators with their rule books. Enter the compliance officers with their rule-based authority. Enter the lawyers and accountants, billing clients by the six minutes for both keeping within the rules and seeking loopholes to exploit. The really significant change in the City of London and its banks and other institutions is the change from the cultural ethical norms of the 1960s and 70s to the post-Big Bang regulated environment. What regulation tends to do is to define the things that are regulated and create enormous opportunities for the unregulated. Hence the use of so-called \"off-balance sheet entities\", that got US banks into such trouble in the sub-prime mortgage crisis, saw tremendous growth because they were outside the purview of the authorities. Where regulators draw clear lines, the animal spirits of free market capitalists will seek to side-step the line or operate outside the regulations. And they will be hugely rewarded for doing it.So in participants' minds, doing \"what is right\" was replaced by doing what is OK by the lawyers and the compliance officers: Doing what you can get away with, you might call it. Now, it would be foolish to mourn too much the vanishing of the old City of London.It was snobby and introverted and uncompetitive and full of restrictive practices, and as such very unhealthy. But it has been replaced by something even more disquieting: a system where short-term gains are king, and anything else is relegated to a sideshow.", "continent": ""},

David Cameron promises a referendum on an arbitrary timetable.\"It is a recipe for two years of uncertainty in which inward investment will drain away, two years of chaos in which businesses will not be able to plan for the future.\"The Conservative response is to point out that many businesses support a referendum on EU membership and that a public vote is a vital part of the reform agenda.\"I think this [a referendum] is the moment Britain stops sleepwalking towards the exit - that's what's happening now,\" Mr Cameron told the Financial Times two weeks ago.\"The British public can see what's happening, that Europe is changing in front of their eyes and they haven't been asked about it.\"Many large businesses will certainly welcome Labour's commitment to Britain remaining in Europe.Labour has quoted a number of pro-EU company leaders in the full page advert the party has taken out in the FT today.\"We would be devastated - as a company that loves London and wants to be in London - if Britain were out of Europe,\" is the view of Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of the mining giant, BHP Billiton.My Labour sources were being very careful to explain last night that the business leaders quoted in the advert were not endorsing Labour.They were simply being quoted to show the strength of feeling about Europe.What is interesting is that Labour has chosen the first day of the election campaign to focus on an area - business - some see as a weakness for the party.Stefano Pessina, the acting chief executive of Walgreens Alliance Boots, lit the \"anti-business\" touch paper for Labour when he said last month that it would be a \"catastrophe\" if Labour politicians acted in government as they spoke in opposition.With promises to intervene in the energy and banking markets and increase the top rate of tax to 50p, some business leaders are wary of Labour.And on Europe, those more sceptical about EU membership argue that the business community should not be viewed as a homogeneous, pro-European block.\"Labour's attempts to portray opposition to an EU referendum as pro-business is as misguided as it is cynical,\" said Robert Oxley, campaign director of Business for Britain. \"Just like voters, business leaders back a referendum as it's the best way to secure meaningful change to our relationship with the EU.\"Mr Miliband hopes that Labour's pro-EU policy will be a win with many businesses and is clear dividing line with the Conservatives.It will be for businesses - and voters - to decide if that is the case.Oh dear. It looks like Labour's much trumpeted business manifesto advert in the Financial Times concerning membership of the European Union has ruffled a few feathers. Siemens has told me that the party \"over-stepped the mark\" when they quoted Juergen Maier, the chief executive of Siemens UK, in the advert.Mr Maier is quoted as saying: \"The prospect of a referendum that may or may not happen, at a date yet to be decided upon, with a choice between two unknown options, is profoundly worrying for business leaders.\"Siemens does not dispute the quote. What it does dispute is its use in a political advert.\"We did not give them permission [to use the quote]. We did not know about this,\" a spokeswoman said. \"We are an a-political organisation.\"Siemens will be contacting Labour to express their displeasure.Chukka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said on the Today programme this morning that the business leaders quoted in the advert were \"aware of what we are doing\".\"The comments they have made are a matter of public record,\" he said.Well, one business at least would dispute whether they were aware about the advert.The spokeswoman said: \"We were consulted about Juergen's quote but not as part of a specific Labour Party campaign as the advertisement could imply.'It seems that Mr Maier's quotes might not be appearing again any time soon in Labour campaign literature.

Only by learning from other nations and confronting failure at home will we give young people a fighting chance of competing for the jobs of the future.\"In response, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt said the results showed the importance of high-quality teachers.\"This report exposes the failings of this government's schools policy: a policy that has sent unqualified teachers into the classroom and prevented effective collaboration between schools.\"Mr Hunt said the government was \"charting a course that will make our international standing worse, not better\".The deputy leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Malcolm Trobe, said it was \"far too early\" for these international tests to show the impact of current education policies.Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, warned politicians against \"misusing the Pisa results to score political points\" and cautioned that \"everyone needs to remember that PISA is not an exact science\".Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the results showed that successful education systems \"pay teachers well, respect the profession and encourage collaboration between teachers and schools\".There were also voices of caution about how these results should be interpreted.  Prof David Spieghalter from the University of Cambridge said \"we should be very cautious in the lessons to be learned\" - and that measuring quality in education was not straightforward.He also highlighted that while South Korean teenagers were at the top end of test results, they were also the unhappiest about their time in school.Prof Alan Smithers from the Centre for Education and Employment Research, University of Buckingham said there were many factors outside school that shaped test results.\"It is disappointing that the UK's 15-year-olds should come so far down the Pisa tables, but is it the fault of the schools? So many other things affect the scores. In the Asian countries that do so well, there are tiger mothers and a lot of out-of school tuition.\"He said that the UK could boost its position by training students to take the tests, but that was not the same thing as improving the education system.\"The danger in the exaggerated importance that politicians attach to Pisa, is that implicitly they are pushing the world to a narrow and particular view of education,\" said Prof Smithers.", "continent": ""},

The UK was rated 26th for maths, 23rd for reading and 21st for science.It is the first time the UK average score has not been ranked in the top 20 in any subject.Scotland does not have its own ranking, but the survey compares the performance of countries which are part of larger states.The research, based on 500,000 pupils around the world, is run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), using a points system.For maths, Scotland scored 498 points, four higher than England, which was second in the UK.For reading, the country scored 506 points, six higher than England.Scotland scored 513 points for science, behind England, which scored 516.Wales performs worst across the three subjects, the research shows.The tables are based on data from 510,000 students across the participating countries in 2012.China tops the league which is dominated by countries from the Far East.The UK's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, broadly the same as the OECD averages for the subjects and putting the country on a par with nations such as the Czech Republic, France, and Norway.The OECD concluded that across all three subjects the UK's average performance in maths has remained unchanged since the Pisa tests in 2006 and 2009.The Scottish government said the \"attainment gap\" between the most advantaged and most disadvantaged pupils had narrowed for the first time.They also pointed out that the survey was conducted before the new Curriculum for Excellence was fully implemented. Learning Minister Alasdair Allan said: \"Scottish school attainment remains strong, particularly in science and reading. \"We are performing at least as well as a number of significant world economies across all three areas, reinforcing our international standing in education. \"There is also clear evidence that the attainment gap is being addressed with a reduction in the variation in performance between those pupils classed as disadvantaged and those who aren't.\"Kenneth Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, said Scotland's teachers were performing well in \"a challenging environment\".He said: \"As the professional body for teaching we know that the quality of teachers working in our schools is high and that the probationer teachers coming into the profession each year are some of the best we have experienced. This is hugely positive for the future of Scottish teaching.\" Mr Muir added: \"Ultimately, league tables such as these do not show the hard work and skill that goes into teaching children and young people and it is important that the commitment of Scotland's teachers does not go unrecognised.\"", "continent": ""},

About 3,000 people each week end up in court on evasion charges. In 2013, 32 people were jailed for not paying the resulting fine, down from 51 the previous year.The publication of the green paper comes a week after the BBC agreed to take on the cost of free TV licences for the over 75s, a policy which could cost the corporation up to \u00a3650m.According to several media reports, the green paper will focus on four or five key themes, including governance and impartiality.Culture secretary John Whittingdale is also expected to look at whether the BBC should do away with \"highly commercial\" entertainment shows like The Voice.The review will also examine other funding models, including a household tax, subscription and a means-tested licence fee. And it will ask whether the BBC should scale back its website, after chancellor George Osborne said it was \"completely crowding out national newspapers\".\"If you look at the BBC website it is a good product,\"  earlier this month, \"but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions\".The Sunday Times  the Green Paper would look at replacing the BBC Trust with broadcasting regulator Ofcom.The government is firing the starting gun on what they hope will be a national debate about what kind of BBC we want to have in the future.The culture secretary John Whittingdale has said it will cover the scope, the scale, the funding and the governance of the BBC. Not least the notion that the BBC should be a much smaller organisation providing public service broadcasting. In other words, specific programmes that the commercial sector cannot provide. It could mean an end to shows like EastEnders, The Voice and Strictly Come Dancing.Meanwhile, we also expect to get the report into whether non-payment of the licence fee should remain a criminal offence. The expectation is that David Perry QC, who oversaw the report, will say criminalisation should stay.Mr Whittingdale has appointed eight people to work on the renewal of the BBC's royal charter - which sets out the corporation's remit - including Dawn Airey, former boss of Channel 5 and journalism professor Stewart Purvis, a former editor-in-chief of ITN.Ms Airey, who is an executive at Yahoo, has previously called for the licence fee to be cut and to consider charging for website output.The panel was criticised by Conservative peer Lord Fowler, who warned in the House of Lords on Tuesday that the BBC was \"under unprecedented attack\".\"I must warn those who support the BBC that we have something of a fight on our hands,\" he said.\"The cards are marked and somewhat stacked against us. The advisory group advising the Secretary of State clanks with special interests and past opinions.\"Speaking at the same debate, Lord Patten, a former chairman of the BBC Trust, called the government's advisory panel \"a team of assistant gravediggers\" who would help the culture secretary \"bury the BBC that we love\".Baroness Neville-Rolfe, government spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, responded by saying \"no-one is seriously proposing the BBC's abolition\".However, she warned, \"one particular area of contention\" was the \"extent to which the BBC manages to meet its impartiality obligations, and how best this should be achieved and regulated.\"Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, made his own case for the corporation on Tuesday, saying \"a BBC that doesn't inform, educate and entertain is not the BBC the public know and love\".Similar sentiments have been expressed by shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant, who said the \"golden thread\" running through the BBC was that \"it provides something for everyone.\"The publication of the green paper on Thursday will be followed by a public consultation.

China stagnated for more than two decades under the rigid authoritarianism of early communist rule and the founder of the people's republic, Mao Zedong.But China now has the world's fastest-growing economy and is undergoing what has been described as a second industrial revolution. It has also launched an ambitious space exploration programme, involving plans to set up a space station by 2020.The People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the previously dominant nationalist Kuomintang in a civil war.The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the PRC on the mainland and the Republic of China based on Taiwan.Beijing says the island of Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland.The claim has in the past led to tension and threats of invasion, but since 2008 the two governments have moved towards a more cooperative atmosphere. The leadership of Mao Zedong oversaw the often brutal implementation of a Communist vision of society.Millions died in the Great Leap Forward - a programme of state control over agriculture and rapid industrialisation - and the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic attempt to root out elements seen as hostile to Communist rule.However, Mao's death in 1976 ushered in a new leadership and economic reform. In the early 1980s the government dismantled collective farming and again allowed private enterprise.The rate of economic change has not been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's largest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people.The authorities still crack down on any signs of opposition and send outspoken dissidents to labour camps.Nowadays China is one of the world's top exporters and is attracting record amounts of foreign investment. In turn, it is investing billions of dollars abroad.The collapse in international export markets that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2009 initially hit China hard, but its economy was among the first in the world to rebound, quickly returning to growth.In February 2011 it formally overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, though by early 2012 the debt crisis in the eurozone - one of the biggest markets for Chinese goods - was beginning to act as a drag on China's growth.As a member of the World Trade Organisation, China benefits from access to foreign markets. But relations with trading partners have been strained over China's huge trade surplus and the piracy of goods.The former has led to demands for Beijing to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and possibly hold back exports. Beijing has responded with a gradual easing of restrictions on trading in the renminbi.Some Chinese fear that the rise of private enterprise and the demise of state-run industries carries heavy social costs such as unemployment and instability.Moreover, the fast-growing economy has fuelled the demand for energy. China is the largest oil consumer after the US, and the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. It spends billions of dollars in pursuit of foreign energy supplies. There has been a massive investment in hydro-power, including the $25bn Three Gorges Dam project.The economic disparity between urban China and the rural hinterlands is among the largest in the world. In recent decades many impoverished rural dwellers have flocked to the country's eastern cities, which have enjoyed a construction boom.By the beginning of 2012, city dwellers appeared to outnumber the rural population for the first time, according to official figures. Social discontent manifests itself in protests by farmers and workers. Tens of thousands of people travel to Beijing each year to lodge petitions with the authorities in the hope of finding redress for alleged corruption, land seizures and evictions.Other pressing problems include corruption, which affects every level of society, and the growing rate of HIV infection. A downside of the economic boom has been environmental degradation; China is home to many of the world's most-polluted cities. Human rights campaigners continue to criticise China for executing hundreds of people every year and for failing to stop torture, as well as for continuing to censor political and artistic expression.The country is keen to stamp down on what it sees as dissent among its ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs in the north-west. Chinese rule over Tibet is controversial. Human rights groups accuse the authorities of the systematic destruction of Tibetan Buddhist culture and the persecution of monks loyal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader who is campaigning for autonomy within China.

{"media_company": "bbc", "news_topic": "Business", "news_link_url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18613988", "news_date": "19 December 2012", "news_title": "Q&A: Libor rate and the regulators", "news_content": "Swiss banking giant UBS has been hit hard for attempting to rig the inter-bank lending rate Libor.It is the second major bank to fall foul of the regulators after Barclays was ordered to pay $450m to UK and US authorities in the summer, and others may well follow.But what exactly is Libor, and why is it so important? Here we take a closer look at the issues involved:Banks lend to each other on a short-term basis, either to make a profit or to cover any shortfalls in cash. For example, a bank may find at the end of a certain day that more customers have made withdrawals than deposits, so it borrows from its rivals to cover the shortfall.Conversely, banks with a cash surplus can make extra profits by lending funds to a rival. The average rate of interest paid by the banks in such interbank lending is called the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).Libor measures the average rate that banks have to pay to borrow from their rivals for a specific period of time - be it a few weeks, months or up to a year. It is calculated on a daily basis by the British Bankers' Association from estimates submitted by the major international banks based in London, and represents the interest rate they must pay in order to borrow cash from other banks. The rate each bank has to pay is in part a reflection of its financial strength, as viewed by its rivals - effectively how much it is trusted.Every day, 16 banks submit the interest rate that they are charged to borrow money. The four highest rates and the four lowest rates are ignored. The average of the eight remaining rates makes up the Libor rate.A bank has to pay a higher interest rate to borrow funds if other lending banks have less confidence in it. This means that the Libor rate gives an indication of the health of the wider banking sector. Libor has a European equivalent called Euribor, which plays the same role for banks based in the eurozone.The Financial Services Authority (FSA) says Libor and Euribor are \"benchmark reference rates fundamental to the operation of both UK and international financial markets\". The prices of trillions of pounds worth of financial transactions around the world are set according to Libor. Among them, financial swap deals worth \u00a3225tn are indexed to Libor, as are loans totalling about \u00a36.4tn, the British Bankers' Association says. Libor, and the interest rate swap deals that are based on them, also provide an important indicator of the markets' expectations about the overnight interest rates likely to be set by the world's big central banks - the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank - in the future.Since the credit crunch first began in 2007, Libor has became an indicator of the financial stress that the major London-based banks found themselves in.Ironically, the interbank lending market on which Libor is based has actually become far less important ., although typically this is only the case for very big mortgage borrowers, such as corporations and property developers.But even for those mortgages that aren't directly linked, Libor still influences the interest rate that banks charge their mortgage or loan customers.That's because the Libor rate reflects the actual interest rate that the banks have to pay when they borrow money from the markets.The Swiss bank admitted its staff had rigged its Libor rate submissions for two main purposes.First, traders manipulated submissions with the express purpose of boosting profits. In fact, according to the FSA, the bank gave traders themselves responsibility for submitting rates to the British Bankers' Association.UBS also said its traders had colluded with counterparts at other banks, with the FSA saying the bank's Tokyo office had gone as far as paying intermediaries to help rig Libor.Second, the bank accepted staff had deliberately lowered its submissions during the financial crisis to give the impression it was able to borrow money more cheaply than it actually could. This created the impression that other banks had more confidence in UBS than they did in reality.The FSA said rigging Libor submissions at UBS was widespread and involved at least 45 people. Staff at Barclays filed misleading figures for interbank borrowings they made. First, between 2005 and 2008 - and sometimes working with traders at other banks - they tried to influence the Libor rate, so as to try to boost their profits. Then between 2007 and 2009, at the peak of the global banking crisis, Barclays filed artificially low figures. This was to try and hide the level of financial stress under which Barclays was operating. The bank's chief executive Bob Diamond was forced to resign from his job, along with Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier.Investigations are continuing across the banking industry, so more evidence is likely to emerge. The FSA and US regulators, along with counterparts is Canada, Japan in Switzerland, are continuing to look into Libor manipulation. There are at least a dozen other banks being investigated, including Citigroup and RBS.The Serious Fraud Office is also considering bringing criminal prosecutions in the UK. Meanwhile, lawsuits have been launched by US municipalities, pension funds and hedge funds. ", "continent": ""},

In return, rules on paying for catch-up services such as iPlayer might be introduced and the licence fee will rise with inflation.Funding free licence fees for over-75s cost the government \u00a3608m in 2013-14 - about a fifth of the BBC's budget.The BBC said it was the \"right deal... in difficult economic circumstances\".BBC director general Tony Hall said: \"Far from being a cut, the way this financial settlement is shaped gives us, effectively, flat licence fee income across the first five years of the next charter.\"Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant said Labour would oppose the government's plans if they were a \"smash and grab raid\" on the BBC.The current BBC charter - which sets out the corporation's remit and how it is governed - is due for renewal at the end of 2016.At first sight today's announcement looks like pretty bad news for the BBC.  The cost of licence fees for the over-75s is only set to rise as the number of households with someone over 75 increases.  Yet the BBC's director general Lord Hall was positively upbeat, claiming the deal he's done with the government is a good one which will leave the BBC, at the end of five years, no worse off and possibly slightly better off - though that's in cash terms, not real terms.  Cue much head-scratching among analysts, trying to work out from the available numbers if the picture is really as rosy as the BBC maintains.And significantly, perhaps, Lord Hall would not rule out possible cuts to services.  But there has also been forthright criticism of the way the deal was done.  Lord Hall and the chair of the BBC Trust, Rona Fairhead, were only told by the government a week ago that this was happening.  Lord Birt, himself a former BBC head, says the government had set \"a very dangerous precedent\" by doing a deal on BBC financing behind closed doors with no public consultation for the second time in five years - suggesting the BBC's independence from government has been compromised.  In a statement to the Commons, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said the charter renewal process would ensure the BBC could \"adapt to a changing media landscape\".Mr Bryant called the announcement an \"utter shambles\" after the plans were revealed in a Sunday newspaper ahead of Wednesday's Budget. In an angry exchange in the Commons, Mr Bryant stressed the process must be \"open and transparent\", adding it was \"no way to run a whelk stall let alone the world's most respected broadcaster\".Mr Whittingdale said he was pleased \"the BBC had agreed to play its part\" in helping tackle the government's \"challenging fiscal position\" while further reducing its \"reliance on taxpayers\".Lord Hall said there had been \"intense negotiations\" to ensure the BBC had \"secured a strong deal for our audiences\".\"If anything, I believe it will put the BBC slightly up,\" he said. \"Crucially, it gives us room for investment in the first two years of that charter. This will help us to manage the transition we all know is coming to an online world.\"In a letter to Mr Whittingdale, BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead said the Trust accepted the decision \"although we cannot endorse the process by which it has been reached\".\"We are disappointed that [licence fee payers] have not been given any say in the major decisions about the BBC's future funding,\" she said.\"However, we accept that those decisions now set a clear financial framework, subject to the terms... for a charter review process that will focus on what the BBC provides in return for its funding. We will want to make sure the public are at the centre of that debate.\"Mr Whittingdale also confirmed plans to bring forward legislation to modernise the licence fee next year \"to cover public service broadcast catch-up TV\".He added the government would \"carefully consider\" decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee.When asked if over 75s would be means-tested to determine whether an individual or household was eligible for the free licence, Mr Whittingdale replied: \"The commitment made in the Conservative manifesto that all households with an over 75-year-old will be eligible to a free TV licence will be honoured throughout this Parliament.\"As requested by the BBC, they will take responsibility for this policy from thereon.\" Speaking on Radio 4, former acting BBC Trust chair Diane Coyle said: \"It's the second time the government has forced a deal on the BBC. \"There has been no consultation with the public and it's a major change in the BBC's responsibilities.

Afghan officers are far better than they were, and monitor their soldiers.They are now trained to talk to soldiers when they come back from leave to see whether they might have faced undue pressure from the Taliban or others.But not all officers are good.The man who shot dead two British soldiers in Lashkar Gah on Monday was an Afghan Army lieutenant.However much training they have, international and Afghan troops need to work together, and that means letting their guard down, and removing their body armour.Some of those killed recently were shot when they were asleep, making it even harder to trust the Afghans they are training and supporting.There is no evidence that the attacks are part of a Taliban strategy, although investigations have shown that many of the killers had false identity papers.Trust has to be a two-way street, and British soldiers have seen incidents which have turned them against the Afghan troops they live among.Stories of Afghan troops keeping boys for sexual purposes, and shooting prisoners, have worsened relations between the two sides.An internal US army survey of relations between US and Afghan troops in eastern Afghanistan,painted a bleak picture. It ran contrary to the official line that these attacks are the work of lone individuals with a grudge.An Afghan colonel is quoted in the report as saying: \"The sense of hatred is growing rapidly.\"He described his own troops as \"thieves, liars and drug addicts\". But for their part, the US soldiers are \"rude, arrogant bullies who use foul language\".British troops have had far more intensive training in recent years to improve cultural awareness, to assist them to cope with the environment of Afghanistan, and to not inadvertently offend Afghan soldiers.I have witnessed mock meetings of Afghan village elders - shuras - held near herds of bemused cattle on Salisbury Plain.And I have heard British officers sometimes compare Afghan enmity with known British rivalry between communities, or football teams, in an effort to increase understanding.But soldiers are not social workers, and there is a limit to how much can be done if trust breaks down.There is a war-weariness among Afghan troops and civilians in their country's long conflict.And the fact remains that more civilians have been killed by one rogue US soldier this year than foreign soldiers who have died at the hands of Afghan troops.", "continent": ""},

The move is reported to cost the BBC \u00a3650m, or one-fifth of its budget.It is also understood the BBC and government are in talks over charging for use of the iPlayer.This could recoup some of the cost of funding free licences for over-75s.It would involve changing the law so that people who watch TV via the iPlayer and other online catch-up services would have to have a TV licence. Currently the licence fee does not cover these digital services. A BBC spokeswoman said it would not comment.By Nick Higham, BBC NewsMr Osborne seems to be offering a deal, perhaps to be announced in the Budget: a commitment to change the law so that iPlayer viewers also have to pay the licence fee.It won't raise anything like enough to make up for that lost \u00a3650m but it would be a sign that the government is serious about protecting the BBC's long-term future in a world of rapidly changing technology.And from the chancellor's point of view, offloading the over-75s' licence fee on to the BBC is a nifty bit of political footwork.It goes a long way towards the government's target of cutting \u00a312bn from the benefits bill.The former chairman of the BBC's board of governors, Sir Christopher Bland, described the proposal as \"the worse form of dodgy Whitehall accounting\".\"It's transferring social policy on to the licence fee,\" he told the BBC's The World This Weekend.\"And of course it already follows the transfer of the World Service and the monitoring service to the licence fee. And neither of those have got anything to do with the licence fee payer.  \"So it's really shoddy accounting.\"Sir Christopher said it would be better for the chancellor to just cut the licence fee by \u00a3650m a year. The Conservatives promised in their election manifesto to continue to allow over-75s to receive free TV licences along with other pensioner benefits. But with the government pledge to make \u00a312bn of welfare savings, it is understood to have the BBC in its sights to help with the nation's finances.Mr Osborne dismissed the notion that the BBC would have to axe major channels or radio stations if it took on the cost of free licences for the elderly.\"I remember five years ago doing a deal with the BBC... where it took on \u00a3500m worth of responsibilities including things like the BBC World Service,\" he told Andrew Marr.\"I was told at the time by people: 'They're going to shut down BBC Two, they're going to close Radio 4'. They always seem to pick the juiciest fruits on the tree.\"I would say the BBC is a well-run organisation under Tony Hall, I'm absolutely sure they can make a contribution. But I want the BBC to have a strong future.\"The chancellor also said the BBC website needed to be looked at \"very carefully\", highlighting it as an area which could be pruned back.Commenting on the likelihood of national newspapers moving purely online in the next decade, he said: \"You wouldn't want the BBC to crowd out national newspapers.\"The chancellor then queried the BBC website carrying \"features and cooking recipes\", saying: \"Effectively the BBC website becomes the national newspaper as well as the national broadcaster.\"He added: \"If you look at the BBC website it's a good product but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions.\"Hailing \"fantastic programmes like Strictly\", he said  the BBC should continue to produce \"popular\" shows \"people want to watch\".He described the BBC as \"a really important national institution and a fantastic broadcaster that produces some of the best television and radio in the world\".

They march in single file in the hope of reducing the chances of triggering a Taliban roadside bomb. But the Taliban are not the only threat to British soldiers. In this year alone, 18 foreign soldiers have been killed by the Afghans they serve alongside. A dramatic jump in so called green-on-blue killings, amounting to an average of one a week this year, has led to a serious erosion of trust. Only Taliban bombs have killed more international soldiers. Maj Bev Allen of the Royal Anglian Regiment, who is leading the British advisers on this patrol,  acknowledges that \"there are moments when we are vulnerable\".\"We live out in austere locations, we have procedures. We remain vigilant at all times, and we try to keep that risk to a minimum,\" he said.\"But it's one of the most important elements of the job we do here. We demonstrate to the Afghans that we trust them, and that we are in the fight and we share the danger with them.\"The soldiers on the patrol say they never fully let their guard down. Only last month, Sgt Luke Taylor and L/Cpl Michael Foley were murdered by an Afghan army sergeant. The Afghan military has apologised but offers little reassurance that it will not happen again. \"We do our best, our intelligence departments try to prevent [the] entering of enemies into the Afghan National Army [ANA] but [we] cannot promise that it will not happen again... I can't say anything about it, it is out of my control,\" Brig Gen Sherin Shah of the ANA said. The soldiers stop for tea. It is a rare moment to relax and the atmosphere is convivial.But troops are now taking more precautions. At all times, someone will remain armed - a guardian angel - to protect against rogue Afghans. And according to a senior Nato-official, further precautions are being taken. ANA soldiers returning from leave in insurgent-affected areas will be screened to see if they have been intimidated. Phones have been withdrawn from Afghan soldiers on operations.Also, Taliban ring tones have been banned, even when the Afghan security forces use them as a joke.Sgt Simon Mercer works closely with Afghan artillery soldiers and sees little difference in them compared to British soldiers.\"You have to be aware about what you're saying, there are cultural taboos that you don't want to cross, talking about women, things like that,\" he said.\"But it's all to be taken with a bit of salt - once you build up a relationship with them, they are just as trustworthy as the soldiers that I work with, day-to-day, in the UK.\"Pte Christopher Jackson took a different view when I asked him if he 100% trusted Afghan soldiers.\"I'd say 70%, you've always got to be wary, because there are some that are not who they say they are, but in general most of them are a decent bunch of lads,\" he replied.The Afghan military did not want us speaking to their soldiers, but in a brief exchange one explained that feelings of distrust are mutual. \"I trust them, as much as they trust me,\" he said.

The Taliban said they were responsible - and that they had soldiers hidden in army ranks waiting to strike. Nato commanders at bases here in the south of Afghanistan, however, insist that the Taliban have not infiltrated the Afghan security forces.But that is open to question. What we do know is that some of those who killed Nato soldiers were at least Taliban sympathisers and that as the Afghan Army and police grow, the number of these attacks will correspondingly increase. The operation ends as darkness falls with an address from Maj Allen. His message is work hard on making this relationship work, because Afghans taking the lead means that British troops can go home. Even though it is eroded, the partnership has never been more important, because these Afghan soldiers are Britain's exit strategy. ", "continent": ""},

The largest ethnic group, the Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs, has lived in China's shadow for centuries. The region has had an intermittent history of autonomy and occasional independence, but was finally brought under Chinese control in the 18th century.Economic development of the region under Communist rule has been accompanied by large-scale immigration of Han Chinese, and Uighur allegations of discrimination and marginalisation have been behind more visible anti-Han and separatist sentiment since the 1990s. This has flared into violence on occasion.Xinjiang, about the size of Iran, is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range.The economy of this once agricultural region has developed fast since 1949, and oil and petrochemicals now account for about 60 per cent of its GDP. It is also an important trade and pipeline route into Central Asia and beyond. The region was contested by various Turkic groups, Mongols and the Chinese until the 18th century, when the Chinese Qing Dynasty brought the whole area under its control. Russia's conquest of the neighbouring Central Asian states of Kokand and Bukhara led to a renewed struggle for control over the area, with the Kokand general Yaqub Bek establishing a de facto independent state in Kashgar in 1865. China gradually regained control of the region and formally set up Xinjiang Province in 1884. Russian influence remained strong, especially during the rule of various warlords after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. The Soviet Union supported an Uighur-led separatist East Turkestan Republic in the north of the region in 1944-1949, but helped to extinguish it when the Communists took over in China proper. Communist China established the Autonomous Region in 1955, and began to encourage Han Chinese to settle there in new industrial towns and farming villages run by the quasi-military Xinjiang Production and Development Corps. China also set up its nuclear testing facility at Lop Nur in the Tarim Basin, conducting the first test there in 1964.In the 2000 census Han Chinese made up 40 per cent of the population of Xinjiang, excluding large numbers of troops stationed in the region and unknown numbers of unregistered migrants, and Uighurs accounted for about 45 per cent. International attention turned to Xinjiang in July 2009 when bloody clashes between Uighurs and Han Chinese in the region's main city, Urumqi, prompted the Chinese government to send large numbers of troops to patrol the streets. Nearly 200 people were killed in the unrest, most of them Han, according to officials. Protests against Chinese rule had already emerged in the 1990s, to which the Chinese authorities reacted forcefully. These culminated in clashes in the city of Yining (Ghulja in Uighur) in 1997 in protest at the execution of 30 alleged separatists. The authorities reported nine dead in the violence, although separatists said more than a hundred protestors were killed. Protests resumed in March 2008 in the cities of Urumqi and Hotan, and spread to Kashgar and elsewhere through the summer - coinciding with the Olympic Games in Beijing. There were reports of bus bombings and attacks on police stations. The main Uighur groups abroad are the separatist East Turkestan Liberation Movement, founded in Turkey in the late 1990s, and the World Uighur Congress, which was set up in Germany in 2004. The latter is led by Rebiya Kadeer, a businesswoman and politician who broke with Beijing over the Ghulja clashes in 1997 and spent years in prison before being allowed to emigrate in 2005. China has said the \"East Turkestan Islamic Movement\" is behind separatist attacks, but exiled Uighurs and independent specialists on the area have cast doubt on whether such an organisation exists. Beijing has sought to deal with the unrest with a mix of repression and efforts to stimulate the region's economy, including through increased investment by state-owned firms.In 2013 there was a sudden upsurge in violence, when the authorities accused separatist \"terrorists\" of attacks in Kashgar that left 21 dead in April. There was further violence in the summer and in 2014, and exiled Uighur groups accused China of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression. ", "continent": ""},

In its latter stages, the conflict held the attention of the world. The US joined the hostilities in order to stem the \"domino effect\" of successive countries falling to Communism.The war produced heavy casualties on both sides, atrocities against civilians, and the indiscriminate destruction and contamination of much of the landscape.A visit to Vietnam by US President Bill Clinton in November 2000 was presented as the culmination of American efforts to normalise relations with the former enemy.Vietnam struggled to find its feet after unification and tried at first to organise the agricultural economy along strict collectivist lines.But elements of market forces and private enterprise were introduced from the late 1980s and a stock exchange opened in 2000.Foreign investment has grown and the US is Vietnam's main trading partner.

We have said this should extend to catch-up services, when people are watching catch-up for example on their tablets.\"They have come up with a more radical solution with a broadcast levy where every household would pay.\"Such a system was introduced in Germany in 2013 and would do away with the need to detect and prosecute those who avoid buying a TV licence, the committee said.Other proposals made by the committee include:Mr Whittingdale, the Conservative MP for Maldon, said the BBC had suffered from \"a succession of disasters of its own making\" in recent years, yet remained \"a widely admired and trusted institution\".The committee's report will feed into the negotiations over the corporation's next royal charter, which will begin after the general election in May.A statement from the BBC Trust, which was set up in 2007 to be the corporation's arms-length regulator, said the report highlighted \"a number of issues and challenges that the Trust recognises and that we are seeking to address\".It added: \"We agree that there must be robust internal governance and independent regulatory oversight of the BBC.

The reasons behind the violence in these two cities, which lie 520km (323 miles) apart on the southern fringes of the Taklamakan Desert, are confused and disputed but some of the essential facts are clear.On 18 July a group of Uighurs armed with knives and explosive devices attacked a police station in Hotan and took hostages. During a rescue operation, at least one police officer, two of the hostages and some of the attackers were killed. Among the grievances of these Uighurs were: the detention of many young male family members without trial after the anniversary of the July 2009 Urumqi riots; attempts to ban women from wearing black headscarves and robes; and the confiscation of their farmland for redevelopment. Some sources have reported that 20 people died in this incident.In Kashgar the violence broke out on 30 July, just before the Ramadan fast. There were two explosions and a hijacked car was driven into pedestrians on a crowded street where Han Chinese workers regularly gather at food stalls: six or seven people died and almost 30 were injured. On the afternoon of 31 July a restaurant in Kashgar was set on fire and the owner and a waiter were killed. Although no specific grievances have been mentioned in connection with these attacks, the citizens of Kashgar have been outraged at the demolition of the traditional Uighur houses in the centre of the old city.The official reason for the demolitions was that the houses were unhygienic and potentially dangerous in an earthquakes, but Uighurs believe that it is simply a stratagem to break up their communities and reduce their influence in the city. People continue to live and work among the ruins: heavily armed police patrol regularly, and very visibly, on foot and in armoured vehicles. The atmosphere is tense.Behind the current conflict lies a long struggle for self-determination by the Uighur people. Although Xinjiang is in the far north-west of China, it is also culturally part of Central Asia and the Uighurs, who are the largest single ethnic group in Xinjiang, are Turkic-speaking Muslims. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the Muslim Central Asian states gained their independence, the dormant Eastern Turkestan independence movement in Xinjiang was stirred into a revival. During China's economic boom, Xinjiang has received considerable state investment in industrial and energy projects that have in theory benefited the whole region. However, there has also been large-scale migration of mainly Han Chinese workers from the east: many Uighurs complain that the Han are taking their jobs.The shocking but not unexpected outbreak of violence in July was not the first in Xinjiang, and it is unlikely to be the last. In July 2009, riots in Urumqi, the administrative capital of Xinjiang, cost the lives of at least 200 people and drew the attention of the world's media to an ethnic and political conflict that has been neglected for decades. In 1995 there were serious disturbances in the north-western city of Ghulja, which had been the headquarters of an independent Eastern Turkestan Republic in the 1940s. A rigorous crackdown by the local government and military developed into a permanent \"Strike Hard\" campaign, and this provoked a further outbreak of demonstrations in February 1997 which were vigorously suppressed. Thousands of Uighurs were detained; some were convicted and imprisoned; others charged with separatist activity were executed. Religious activities, which have become less restricted in the rest of China, were curtailed in Xinjiang; children under the age of 18 and Communist Party and government officials were forbidden even to enter a mosque for prayers.The official response has been to characterise these outbreaks of violence simply as \"terrorist\" acts and to blame outside forces, including Uighur groups based in the United States and in Europe. Overseas groups actively promote the idea of an independent Eastern Turkestan, but there is no evidence linking them directly with violence inside Xinjiang. More recently Beijing has pointed to international terrorist organisations, including al-Qaeda, as possible culprits: but again no concrete evidence has been produced. In 2003 the death was announced of Hasan Mesum, who had been shot in South Waziristan on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and he was identified as the leader of the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). In the wake of the recent attacks in Hotan and Kashgar, the Chinese authorities have revived concerns about terrorists trained by ETIM in Pakistan although most specialists do not even believe that ETIM exists as a real organisation.

{"media_company": "bbc", "news_topic": "Europe", "news_link_url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11216061", "news_date": "1 July 2013", "news_title": "Q&A: Reform of EU farm policy", "news_content": "The European Union is negotiating a major reform of its Common Agricultural Policy.The programme is the most expensive scheme in the EU - accounting for more than 40% of its annual budget - and one of the most controversial.In June 2013 ministers reached a deal with Euro MPs and the European Commission, though the reform package has not yet been agreed in full.The Commission's original goal was to shift rewards away from intensive farming to more sustainable practices - but environmentalists say that ambition has been watered down. There is also a drive to create more of a \"level playing field\", to give young people an incentive to get involved in an industry dominated by older farmers and traditional vested interests.Political parties of all shades, farmers' unions, environmental campaigners and taxpayer groups have all voiced concern about the reforms.Agriculture has been one of the flagship areas of European collaboration since the early days of the European Community. In negotiations on the creation of a Common Market, France insisted on a system of agricultural subsidies as its price for agreeing to free trade in industrial goods. The CAP began operating in 1962, with the Community intervening to buy farm output when the market price fell below an agreed target level. This helped reduce Europe's reliance on imported food but led before long to over-production, and the creation of \"mountains\" and \"lakes\" of surplus food and drink. The Community also taxed imports and, from the 1970s onward, subsidised agricultural exports. These policies have been damaging for foreign farmers, and made Europe's food prices some of the highest in the world. European leaders were alarmed at the high cost of the CAP as early as 1967, but radical reform began only in the 1990s. The aim has been to break the link between subsidies and production, to diversify the rural economy and to respond to consumer demands for safe food, and high standards of animal welfare and environmental protection. In 2013 the budget for direct farm payments (subsidies) and rural development - the twin \"pillars\" of the CAP - is 57.5bn euros (\u00a349bn), out of a total EU budget of 132.8bn euros (that is 43% of the total). Most of the CAP budget is direct payments to farmers. Regional aid - known as \"cohesion\" funds - is the next biggest item in the EU budget, getting 47bn euros.The CAP has been steadily falling as a proportion of the total EU budget for many years. In 1970, when food production was heavily subsidised, it accounted for 87% of the budget. For the EU's new member states, in Central and Eastern Europe, direct payments to farmers are being phased in gradually. The eastward enlargement increased the EU's agricultural land by 40% and added seven million farmers to the existing six million.The proposals include:Keeping EU farm spending level until 2020, though it may be reduced by inflation. This will disappoint some countries, like the UK, that wanted the CAP scaled back significantly.The Commission proposed to cap at 300,000 euros the total subsidy a large farm could receive - but that appears unlikely to get into the final deal. The idea was to combat large payments going to aristocratic landowners and wealthy agri-businesses, but it ran up against powerful lobby groups. Levelling imbalances in payments. Subsidising acreage farmed, rather than production totals, should lead to less intensive farming. Big disparities between high subsidies to farmers in the western EU, and much lower ones to those in the east, should also be levelled out. Under the reform plan, no member state's farmers should receive less than 65% of the EU average. And the biggest farms would lose up to 30% of their payout - money that would be redistributed to help smaller farms.Ending sugar production quotas. These are seen to heavily disadvantage competing farmers in poor countries; and they pay huge amounts to giant European agri-businesses.There has been intense debate about \"greening\" - the Commission's proposal to make 30% of the direct payment received by farmers dependent on environmental criteria. MEPs and governments insist on flexibility, to allow for the diverse circumstances of Europe's farms. So these greening targets have been watered down, environmentalists say: the requirement for arable farmers to grow at least three different crops, to promote biodiversity; for farmers to leave 7% of their land fallow, to encourage wildlife; and for farmers to maintain pasture land permanently, rather than ploughing it up.The definition of an \"active farmer\" has also been contentious. The current payments system is largely based on land area and past subsidy levels, meaning that landowners like airports and sports clubs, which do not farm, have been getting subsidies based on their grasslands or other eligible land areas.EU ministers have agreed on a \"short mandatory negative list comprising airports, railway services, waterworks, real estate services and permanent sports and recreational grounds\".The two-pillar payments system is likely to stay. Currently direct payments and price support (pillar one) account for more than 70% of the CAP budget, while rural development (pillar two) gets less than a quarter. On average, pillar one payments provide nearly half of farmers' income in the EU.Overall, farmers in the 15 older EU member states benefit much more from the CAP than the newer members.Nationally France benefits most, with about 17% of CAP payments, followed by Spain (13%), then Germany (12%), Italy (10.6%) and the UK (7%).France is the biggest agricultural producer, accounting for some 18% of EU farm output. Germany comes second, with about 13.4%. Germany is a net contributor to the CAP budget and France will be too in the near future.The average annual subsidy per farm is about 12,200 euros (\u00a310,374). But payments per hectare range from 527 euros in Greece to just 89 euros in Latvia, because of the transitional arrangements for new member states. The latter are allowed national farm aid to compensate for lower EU subsidies.CAP subsidies have been blamed for perpetuating inequalities in global food distribution - like the subsidies which protect farmers in other industrialised countries, such as the US and Japan. Combined with import tariffs on food, the subsidies make it harder for developing countries to compete.Large agri-businesses and big landowners receive more from the CAP than Europe's small farmers who rely on traditional methods and local markets. About 80% of farm aid goes to about a quarter of EU farmers - those with the largest holdings. Major beneficiaries include rich landowners such as the British royal family and European aristocrats with big inherited estates, according to farmsubsidy.org, a group campaigning for EU transparency.Yes. The EU agreed that milk quotas, which help protect dairy farmers' income, would be phased out. To cushion the blow, the quotas are rising by 1% a year, before they expire in 2015. Yet there have been widespread protests by dairy farmers.Italy, which overshot its milk quotas, was allowed to implement the full quota increase from 2009. The EU has scrapped the arable \"set-aside\" policy - a response to fresh concerns about food security. Farmers had been leaving some land fallow, to prevent surpluses accumulating, but that land will now be put back into production. Conservationists are dismayed, saying set-aside has been very beneficial for wildlife. A reform of the EU sugar regime was adopted in 2006. The guaranteed price of sugar was cut by 36%, following protests from developing countries seeking to export sugar to the EU. In international trade negotiations food subsidies are a major sticking point, as farmers are powerful lobbyists in other countries too, and no breakthrough was achieved in the Doha Round global trade talks.One of the biggest criticisms, especially from campaigners against poverty in developing countries, is that the CAP encourages European agri-businesses to export huge quantities of food worldwide that poor farmers cannot compete with on price. The CAP is seen as part of an unfair trade system rigged in favour of the richer countries.Another widely held view is that Europe is spending far too much on the CAP - when agriculture generates just 1.6% of EU GDP and employs only 5% of EU citizens. With Europe's economic growth in the doldrums, and fierce competition from emerging giants like China and India, the EU needs to pay less for farming and invest more in scientific research and technology, the CAP critics say. There is also pressure to spend less on subsidies and more on agricultural research, to improve crop varieties and livestock, which could benefit developing countries.Even the CAP's supporters agree that there is much room for improvement. Copa-Cogeca says farmers need to obtain a fair income from the market - they want a \"level playing field\". Farmers complain that other players in the food chain, such as distributors and commodity speculators, reap the rewards while their income is falling. They want the EU to improve farmers' bargaining power and make market data more transparent.If Europe wants to maintain the rich diversity of its rural areas and keep people on the land then it must carry on subsidising farmers, the CAP's defenders say.Many smallholders work long hours, earning less than the average income, and without the CAP they would go out of business, the argument goes. Their role is vital in safeguarding the character of Europe's countryside - and often picturesque mountain areas are also the most precarious for the rural economy. The number of people working on farms roughly halved in the 15 older EU member states between 1980 and 2003. About 2% of farmers leave agriculture every year across the EU - and in some countries the figure is higher. Meanwhile, a growing number of farmers are over 50, so the EU has to provide a financial incentive to attract younger people into farming, CAP supporters say.Copa-Cogeca warns that cutting subsidies would mean a huge reduction in the number of farmers and an intensification of farming in certain areas. Some fear that agricultural conglomerates and US-style factory farms could change Europe's landscape if the CAP goes.Europeans demand very high standards of food safety, animal welfare and consumer choice - and that comes at a price, the argument goes. Globally, CAP supporters say Europe's surpluses can ease food shortages in the developing world. Food security has become a pressing issue again since food prices soared in recent years. Global warming and overpopulation are increasingly squeezing food resources in many regions. Europe's post-war achievement of food security is seen as one of the EU's successes - after years of hunger and rationing for many.", "continent": ""},

At a time when the government in Westminster is slashing public spending, they argue that the budget for farm subsidies also needs to be dramatically cut.Paying for the CAP costs the average British family of four some \u00a3426 (488 euros; $666) a year. And while ministers have yet to suggest exactly how much it should be cut by, clearly they believe that the reduction should be more than the proposed figures emerging from Brussels.The changing economic climate means it is increasingly difficult to explain to taxpayers why rich landowners with profitable farms receive so much public money. The Duke of Westminister, for instance, received a reported \u00a35.8m pounds over the 10 years to 2009.But the UK does support EU proposals to make more farm subsidies less dependent on the food a farmer produces, and more dependent on \"public goods\" - for instance, on how farmers treat biodiversity, natural habitats and the landscape.Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Jim Paice said: \"Yes we want to spend less on the CAP and less on the whole European budget. \"But whatever the budget is,  it is also the overall structure of the CAP that really matters - how you distribute it either as a direct payment for doing very little or actually targeting  for things people really want to pay for.\"As an example, ministers believe that subsidy should be channelled to hill farmers who rear sheep in some of Britain's most beautiful and rugged landscapes. Their sheep are essential to maintain the countryside, but making a living would be impossible without the \u00a320,000 or so they receive annually in farm subsidy.Andrew Harrison is a hill farmer in the Lake District in North-West England. He loves his job and the hard work that comes with it. However, producing lamb and wool in these conditions can barely cover the rent and other costs of running his business. The entire profit margin for many upland farmers is what they receive in EU subsidy.For Mr Harrison it is all very simple. He says that without his EU payment he could not continue.\"Well without it, basically I would have to leave the key in the door and walk away,\" he says.\"There wouldn't be any farming in the uplands without the subsidy or something to substitute for it.\"The British government's vision of the future would continue to see farmers like Andrew Harrison receive public money for his work as a steward of the landscape.And there would be less money linked to food production - which sees some of the biggest, most industrialised, most profitable farms qualifying for the EU subsidy.

Farmers need Europe's support. The Common Agricultural Policy is what feeds us, it's the future of more than half of our territory.\"Farming unions fear farmers will face even more bureaucracy in order to qualify for the payments on which they rely to continue in business.Gail Soutar of Britain's National Farmers Union also said it was important to direct support to \"active farmers... who are producing a crop or a litre of milk, we don't want support to go to people who are no longer producing... sofa farmers\".Lobby group Friends of the Earth said the proposals would continue subsidising factory farming, and not do enough to change farming practices.A spokesman said the changes would have \"devastating consequences for rainforests, the climate and some of the world's poorest people\".The British government, which has called for a reduction in the overall size of the CAP, said the reforms should have focused more closely on food security and biodiversity.But British Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said she was worried that the Commission's proposals \"will be far too backward-looking and this precious opportunity will be lost\".The Commission's plans will be subject to debate and revision, before they are agreed by EU governments and the European Parliament.

He said the corporation will use its \"own airwaves\" to tackle hostility towards the \u00a3145.50 cost in the future.Lord Hall said a TV licence worked out at \"just 40p a day\" for the BBC's news, drama, radio and online content. But  the message needed to be communicated more clearly.According to media commentator Steve Hewlett, the BBC often uses its airwaves \"to promote itself as an institution\" - with campaigns such as 1997's Perfect Day video.\"Where the distinction comes is if the BBC uses its airwaves to promote its own interests,\" he told the BBC News website.\"Promoting 'Your BBC' is one thing,\" he continued. \"Promoting the BBC's perceived corporate interests in relation to a matter of public policy is something else.\"The BBC shouldn't be embarrassed about telling people what it does and what it's there for. But to use its airwaves to promote itself in a more political way than that is potentially problematic.\"Lord Hall, who took over the corporation's top job in April, said the BBC was currently providing better value for money than it had done for 20 years. He revealed he had a team working on ways to promote the BBC's position, in the run-up to charter renewal negotiations in 2016.\"We've got to get aggressive, frankly, about making this case to people,\" he said.He argued that, adjusted for inflation, the licence fee had dropped in price over the last 20 years - from \u00a3147 in 1993, to its current level of \u00a3145.50.At the same time, audiences have seen the number of services increase - with four times as many television channels and twice as many national radio stations, compared to 1993.\"We are delivering more without costing more and will continue to do that. In fact, as the licence fee is frozen - with no account taken of inflation and it's paying for more things - it will cost you less,\" said Lord Hall.However, faced with the task of saving the corporation more money he warned: \"We must not stretch the elastic too thin.\"He said the BBC was currently going through budgets in detail to get a clearer understanding of where its money was going, but added it was \"too early to get into discussions about 'can you dump this or dump that?'\"Earlier this month, David Dimbleby said the corporation needed to \"redefine\" its role and examine \"whether it is too powerful for its own good\".The Question Time host told Richard Bacon's Five Live radio show that the BBC could \"maybe cut back a bit on its number of television channels\".Speaking on Wednesday, however, Lord Hall said he was mindful of the backlash around the proposed closure of digital radio station 6 Music in 2010.\"People will pick on things and say, 'you can lose that' and a whole lot of other licence fee-payers will rightly say, 'that's of huge value'.\"", "continent": ""},

It is one a set of objectives the BBC Trust gave director general Tony Hall in July, which were made public for the first time today. The targets were published  into how the BBC is governed, following what the trust called \"a number of significant failures\".Several changes will be made to make the BBC more \"accountable and transparent\". The BBC Trust will regularly publish the objectives it sets for Lord Hall from now on. It said the \"quality, variety and originality of new drama on BBC One\" should be one of his \"immediate priorities\", especially in peak time. BBC One has recently enjoyed success with Doctor Who and Last Tango in Halifax. However, other dramas such as The White Queen and Ripper Street - which was cancelled last week - have not done so well. The \"quality and prominence\" of BBC One and BBC Two's current affairs coverage was another key area where Lord Hall was encouraged to \"achieve new peaks of distinctiveness\" by looking at the \"creative culture\" in TV management and commissioning.The governance review was launched in September following \"a year of difficult events at the BBC\". They included revelations about late presenter Jimmy Savile, multi-million pound pay-offs to senior management and the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which wasted almost \u00a3100m. The review's key conclusion is that there has been \"confusion about who is responsible for what in certain key operational areas and this has undermined confidence in the governance and operation of the BBC\". BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said he and Lord Hall had now agreed some \"sensible changes\" to the working relationship between the Trust and the BBC Executive, to make things clearer in terms of their roles and responsibilities. There will now be new three-stage performance reporting, to ensure better monitoring of specific BBC projects. It will enable issues to be identified and dealt with early  - unlike the DMI project, which was supposed to modernise the BBC's video production and archive systems, but which collapsed after five years, at a cost of \u00a398.4m.The BBC's Executive Board, which is responsible for making decisions, will now have to report to the Trust more often and more comprehensively throughout the year, so that the trust can assess how it is doing.Some of these meetings will be filmed and broadcast on the trust website, including end of year discussions about the corporation's performance.The trust will also ask licence fee payers to help set the priorities for the BBC each year, but it will no longer involve itself in operational decision making.\"This is an important first step in making the BBC simpler and better run,\" said Lord Hall of the changes, which come into effect from 1 April, 2014. The BBC has also appointed former Sony chairman and CEO, Sir Sir Howard Stringer, to strengthen the team and bring his \"extensive broadcasting and commercial experience\" to the BBC Executive Board from 1 January, as one of two new Non-Executive Directors.\"People don't just expect the BBC to produce great programmes, they want it to be run well,\" said Lord Patten. \"While much has gone well in the past, the last 15 months have seen a number of significant failures. [These changes mean] the BBC can get on with the job of running the BBC, and the Trust can rightly focus on holding the Executive to account on behalf of licence fee payers.\"One of the other objectives laid out by the Trust, and originally sent to Lord Hall in July, is that \"BBC managers need to spend public money as if it is their own money\". In an effort to improve the value for money provided to licence fee payers, the BBC is also tasked with providing \"a clear and sustainable response to the NAO's review on severance payments, to make sure we put a stop to any future excessive payments\". Lord Hall announced within his first few weeks in the job that he would put a \u00a3150,000 cap on pay-offs for senior managers.Other objectives include pursuing new creative partnerships with other major cultural organisations and institutions and responding to the general issues revealed by the Pollard report. It looked into what went wrong in the reporting of Jimmy Savile allegations and why a Newsnight investigation was dropped by the BBC. ", "continent": ""},

All the changes mean a 16% real terms cut in BBC funds over six years.BBC director general Mark Thompson said it was \"a realistic deal\", but the National Union of Journalists said the BBC should have fought the plans.George Osborne told the Commons that changes in funding amounted to \"\u00a3340m of savings a year for the Exchequer by 2014-15\".\"To ensure that the cost of these new obligations is not passed on to the licence fee payer, the BBC has agreed a funding deal for the full duration of its charter review,\" he said.The arrangement was to freeze the licence fee for the next six years, he added.\"This deal helps almost every family and is equivalent to a 16% saving in the BBC budget over the period, similar to the savings in other major cultural institutions.\"As part of the deal, the BBC says it will now part-fund S4C \"along similar principles to the BBC Alba service in Scotland\".BBC Alba - the Scottish Gaelic language service - is funded by the corporation in partnership with the Scottish government.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) currently funds S4C to the tune of just under \u00a3100m a year.The government also funds the World Service and picks up part of the cost of BBC Monitoring, which monitors, translates and analyses media coverage from around the world.Mr Thompson said: \"This is a realistic deal, in exceptional circumstances, securing a strong independent BBC for the next six years.\"It means that efficiency and reform will continue to be key issues for us. But our focus remains providing distinctive, high quality programmes valued by the public. This deal will safeguard that until 2017.\"BBC Trust chairman Michael Lyons said: \"The BBC is not government funded, but these are pressing times for the nation as a whole and we believe licence fee payers would expect us to see what contribution we can properly make.\"The BBC's extra responsibilities were \"consistent with this and will deliver benefits to licence fee payers across the UK\", he added. \"Sorting out DCMS's budget settlement was an extraordinarily gruelling process, all the more so because we ended up negotiating the BBC's next licence fee settlement as part of it. \"In the end the deal we got was tough but fair. Tough because the BBC, like everyone, is going to have to make demanding efficiency savings.\"But fair because it allows them to continue to make the great programmes that we all love, and licence fee payers won't have to pay any extra for the privilege.\" In an e-mail to its members at the BBC, the National Union of Journalists said the deal was \"a watershed moment\" for the corporation. \"It is our view that the BBC should have fought these plans, and rallied its supporters, rather than accept such a devastating deal which could lead to thousands of job losses and the wholesale closure of services,\" it said.The deal appeared to have been \"struck at the 11th hour with no consultation with listeners, viewers or staff\", it added.Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of broadcasting union Bectu, accused the BBC of \"doing the government's dirty work\".\"How can you cut 16% off your costs without affecting jobs or services?\" he said.\"Morale at the BBC is already at rock bottom, but now there is little or no confidence in the management.\"Meanwhile, shadow foreign secretary Yvette Cooper has warned that \"jettisoning\" the World Service from the Foreign Office \"at this late stage, without serious consultation or a strategy for its future, is cavalier and short-termist\".\"Although editorially independent, the World Service is a key component of UK diplomacy and does important work promoting British values and open debate across the world,\" she said.It has also been announced that money the BBC had ringfenced to pay for the switchover to digital TV - about \u00a3150m a year - will now contribute to the broadband rollout.The BBC Trust earlier warned the government it would fight any plans to force the corporation to meet the cost of free television licences for the over-75s.", "continent": ""},

Mr Shapps' comments come after negative publicity over pay-outs to top executives and the handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal.Numerous allegations against Savile, who presented programmes including Jim'll Fix It during a long career at the BBC, emerged after his death in 2011 and police have since described him as a \"prolific, predatory sex offender\".Mr Shapps also mentioned the case of former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall, who is currently serving a prison sentence for a series of sexual assaults on young girls.Mr Shapps said the BBC was in danger of \"frittering away\" public trust.\"They have ended up working in this culture which is buried in the last century, which is 'we are the BBC, we do what we like, we don't have to be too accountable'.\"But they are raising \u00a33.6bn through the licence fee, which is a tax, and, quite rightly, the public wants to have sight of how the money is spent. Things like the pay-offs have really caused concern, as have, obviously, things like Savile and Hall and the culture that goes around that. I think it is one of too much secrecy,\" he said.BBC director general Lord Hall should consider opening the corporation's books to full inspection by the National Audit Office (NAO), publishing all expenditure over \u00a3500 - including stars' salaries - and opening up to freedom of information requests, he said.With the current royal charter allowing the BBC's licence fee coming up for renewal at the end of 2016, Mr Shapps also indicated he would consider changing the system which sees the broadcaster receive all of the money raised through the licence fee.There were \"lots of different ways\" the money could be used to fund public service broadcasting, he said.There was also a \"question of credibility\" for the BBC over whether it applied \"fairness\" to its reporting of politics, Mr Shapps added.A BBC spokesman said: \"Mr Shapps is right that transparency is key to the future of the BBC. So is its freedom from political pressure.\"The BBC and the BBC Trust actively encourages the public to tell us what it thinks of our services and help us police our own guidelines. On TV and radio they personally hold its executives to account.\" He said in 2012, the corporation dealt with more than 1,600 freedom of information requests and volunteered information on hundreds more. It has appeared in front of 16 parliamentary committees in 2013, and the NAO already has full access to the BBC's operations except its editorial decisions, he added.In July, the BBC was criticised by the National Audit Office for paying out \u00a325m in severance to 150 senior BBC managers, and risking \"public trust\".Earlier this month the BBC's director general Tony Hall promised the corporation would have a closer relationship with its audience in future, treating them as \"owners\" rather than licence fee payers.Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said it was \"absolutely wrong\" for Mr Shapps to make his comments.\"He's the chair of the Conservative Party, it's not come from the Secretary of State for Culture Maria Miller,\" she told BBC's The Andrew Marr Show.\"He's using the fact we're heading into a charter review and licence fee review in order to put pressure on the BBC because the Conservatives are trying to somehow blame [them] for having to report the government is not succeeding in so many ways.\"Some of the Tories are against the BBC because it's a public corporation - they have never liked it and they see any opportunity to give it a good kicking.\"The BBC have given that opportunity with the extortionate high salaries and the way they handled Jimmy Savile, but it is still a massively important organisation and the government should support it.\"Former BBC director general Greg Dyke also told Marr that Mr Shapps's comments should not be taken seriously.\"This is so predictable - 18 months from an election and the government decides to start pressuring the BBC,\" he said.\"It's an attempt to intimidate the BBC which is what governments do, and it's the BBC's job to resist.\"Two or three things have happened that have been pretty unpleasant for the BBC, but that doesn't mean the whole of what the BBC stands for should be threatened.\"", "continent": ""},

But excluding London and the South East of England, the cost of a home was still 6.3% higher than 12 months before.The governor of the Bank of England said he would take prompt action, if action was needed.Writing in the Bank's annual report, Mark Carney said: \"We will not hesitate to take further proportionate and graduated action as warranted,\" Carney said. He added that the Bank's Financial Policy Committee, which is meeting today, had announced measures in November to reduce stimulus to the housing market.\"In March, the ONS calculated that the annual rate of increase had fallen back slightly to 8%, so the April figures shows the market accelerating once again.April house price inflation was 10.4% in England, 3.3% in Wales, 4.8% in Scotland and 2.6% in Northern Ireland - all higher than the previous month.First-time buyers continue to experience more rapid price increases than people moving house.A rise in London house prices of 18.7% in the year to April is more than 20 times as fast as the average rise in pay (up 0.9%). Even if you strip out London and the south-east of England, prices nationally are up 6.3%. We need a reliable measure of what house price inflation is doing to the cost of living. Do we have it? Not exactly. The ONS leaves housing costs out of its Consumer Price Index on the grounds that a house is an asset, not something you consume. But for many people - especially younger people - housing costs are by far their biggest single cost. The ONS answer until now has been to produce another statistic, CPIH, which includes housing costs. Yet, even as house prices roared away, CPIH didn't rise but actually dropped, from 1.6% to 1.4%. How? Because it measures owner-occupiers' housing costs by looking at what they would pay if they rented. Not the mortgages people actually pay. And the numbers assume that housing costs make up just 15% of the average expenditure. But ask young people whether they spend just 15% on housing - and you'll get a funny look. Many older people may have paid off their mortgages. The statistics mask gaping differences between the generations. Perhaps younger people could use an alternative measure of the cost of living that reflects their reality - where housing costs are by far the biggest burden. Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \"Each rise in prices means more people stuck living in their childhood bedrooms, or trapped in the cycle of moving from one expensive rented home to the next.  \"This is a problem that the government can fix. We need a new generation of quality part-buy, part-rent homes, and to make sure that small builders can get hold of the land and finance necessary to build them.The ONS reports its figures a month later than other organisations, though the calculation is based on the widest sample of mortgages.The Halifax has already estimated May's year-on-year increase at 8.7%.The Nationwide building society said May saw an annual rise of more than 11%, although it suggested that the market might be coming off the boil.Last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to give the Bank of England the power to impose a cap on home loans related to income or the value of the house.At present, the Bank can advise on such a cap, but not impose it. The new power should be in place before the end of this Parliament in 2015, the chancellor said.", "continent": ""},

All 10, except Cyprus, are former communist countries and they use a different system of farm support, called SAPS. The auditors say the SPS has encouraged farmers to respond better to market demand and has benefited EU agriculture as a whole.But they say the way the scheme's beneficiaries were  defined \"permitted persons or entities not, or only marginally, engaged in an agricultural activity to benefit from SPS payments\".In some cases landowners have carried on receiving the payments even though their land is worked by tenant farmers who do not get the subsidy.In the UK the auditors found some individual beneficiaries receiving up to 1m euros annually or even more in SPS aid without having any agricultural activity on their land.The report also highlights examples of non-agricultural land qualifying for SPS payments in France, Italy and Spain.The European Commission has said EU farm spending should no longer be based on previous subsidy levels for farmers.But the commission believes subsidies are still needed to protect Europe's food supplies and rural diversity.

Leaders of the National Union of Journalists and the broadcasting union Bectu claim plans to cut 2,000 jobs over five years have led to \"compulsory redundancies, unacceptable workloads and stress, and increased cases of bullying and harassment\".The BBC imposed 20% budget cuts after the freezing of the licence fee and new obligations to pay for the BBC World Service and the Welsh fourth channel S4C.Meanwhile, arts leaders including National Theatre artistic director Sir Nicholas Hytner have focused on Lord Hall's previous role at the Royal Opera House, urging him to improve arts programming.Sir Nicholas accused the corporation of having a \"Downton ratings mentality\" and said it was not doing enough to put the arts on television.And that is on top of the problems that led to Hall's appointment in the first place, when the BBC was plunged into crisis over the Jimmy Savile scandal, which led to the sudden resignation of his predecessor George Entwistle.Lord Hall hopes his arrival will open a new chapter for the BBC, allowing it to put those problems behind it and focus on the future. Announcing his first senior appointments two months ago, he said: \"It is my first task to build the team that will deliver a new strategy and creative vision for the BBC and define public service broadcasting for the next decade.\" That will include negotiating the next BBC charter and licence fee settlement with the government.Lord Hall sprang a surprise in February when he made James Purnell, the former Labour culture secretary, a key member of his top management team.Purnell is to take on a new and wide-ranging role as director of strategy and digital, pulling together the BBC's policy-making, future media and communications activities, including marketing and audience research.The appointment of a former Labour culture minister, without a formal selection process, caused some controversy among Conservative MPs, although the government expressed no objection. Purnell was the BBC's head of corporate planning under John Birt, the director general who introduced radical changes to modernise the corporation 20 years ago. He set out his thinking - some called it a job application - in an article in  last November, headed \"The BBC should learn from the Birt era\".Purnell wrote: \"The BBC was saved by Lord Birt's boldness. It would have been easy to play it safe, to avoid mistakes, lest they incense the BBC's enemies. But instead it reviewed its programmes, transforming Radio 1 as well as its output of drama and entertainment.\"Rather than wait and see what the internet would bring, as ITV essentially did, the BBC rode the wave of a country surfing online. The next director-general needs to learn from the 1990s.\"Lord Hall is well placed to do so. He became director of news in Birt's 1993 reorganisation, with a brief to bring TV and radio news together for the first time. He later launched Radio 5 Live, BBC News 24 and BBC News Online. He is bringing in another outsider to a key role. Anne Bulford was chief operating officer at Channel 4 (where Hall was a board member for several years) and before that was finance director of the Royal Opera House (where he was chief executive). She has been made managing director of BBC finance and operations on a salary of \u00a3395,000.That is less than she earned at Channel 4, but has prompted reminders of another long-running BBC problem that Lord Hall must face up to - senior management pay.Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: \"At a time when the BBC are saying they are having to cut back on programme budgets because of the squeeze on the licence fee, it is extraordinary that they think this is an appropriate amount to pay in public money to an individual, however good. \"It demonstrates they are still completely out of touch with the world in which most people have to live today.\"Two current BBC directors have moved to new roles. Helen Boaden, who was director of news for eight years, has been made director of radio, while Tim Davie, who has been acting director general for the past four months, moves to a role in charge of the BBC's global activities.One of Lord Hall's first tasks will be to appoint a new director of news and a new director of television. The news role is particularly important following the criticisms of the handling of two Newsnight crises - one over the failure to broadcast the original investigation into allegations against Jimmy Savile and the subsequent programme that led Lord McAlpine to be wrongly implicated in claims of child abuse.That job is widely expected to go to an outsider.While he wants the BBC to make a fresh start and look to the future, Lord Hall also knows that the reverberations from Savile will continue for a while longer and that there are lessons still to be learned, both cultural and managerial. Further revelations will continue to emerge, prompted by the accusations of sexual abuse by Savile and others. The Dame Janet Smith Review, which is examining the culture and practices within the BBC during Savile's time, has heard from hundreds of witnesses and will report later in the year.Before then, another inquiry, headed by Dinah Rose QC, will report on the current culture at the BBC, amid accusations that bullying and harassment still go on in the corporation. Lord Hall must also tackle a management culture described by the chairman of the BBC Trust Lord Patten as \"dysfunctional\" and \"chaotic\" in evidence to the Pollard Review of the Savile affair. But he will also be aware that, in the end, the BBC must be judged on its creativity - \"it's the programmes, stupid\" - and its relationship with its audiences. And these in turn will continue to be affected by the rapid changes in technology that have transformed the media landscape in recent years.From radio to television to online and the iPlayer, the BBC has always managed to keep in touch with the future. That may prove Lord Hall's hardest task in the coming years.", "continent": ""},

It's vital that this is a genuine fresh start, one that marks the dismantling of a culture that has allowed bullying and harassment to take hold.\"The Respect At Work review was set up after the Jimmy Savile scandal erupted last year. Its initial remit was to look specifically at BBC policies relating to sexual harassment, though that remit was subsequently broadened.The report found there had been 37 formal complaints of sexual harassment over the past six years - an average of six per year - out of a workforce of approximately 22,000 staff and 60,000 freelancers.\"The report finds that thankfully incidents of sexual harassment at the BBC today are rare. However we shouldn't be complacent as just one case, is one too many,\" wrote Lord Hall.\"Our staff are our greatest strength and this report shows that they are proud to work for the BBC and that we have a culture based on values that are strongly held.\"", "continent": ""},

The new director general, Tony Hall, said the organisation \"could not be tone-deaf\" to what the public have said about large pay-offs.The BBC was accused of \"rewarding failure\" over the \u00a3450,000 paid to Lord Hall's predecessor, George Entwistle.Lord Hall said the BBC would consult on the plans with staff and unions.\"I appreciate that making changes to existing contracts is never easy. But it is to the great credit of the senior leadership team at the BBC that there is broad recognition of the need for change,\" he said, in a statement.Speaking about the proposals to MPs at the commons culture committee, Lord Hall said they represent a \"fair way forward\" for staff and for licence fee payers.\"I am committed to lowering senior management pay level, but I also want to get the best people. We are in a competitive market,\" he said.The National Union of Journalists has welcomed the plans. \"I hope this is the first of a number of measures by Lord Hall to cut waste at the BBC,\" said General secretary Michelle Stanistreet.The measures, which are due to take effect in September 2013 will affect 250 people, Lord Hall added.\"We are consulting with staff and unions. It's a contractual change for senior managers and other members of staff, which we rightly have to consult on.\"I am confident we will get the agreement and people will see the sense of it. It is a matter of principle for me and something that responds to the public mood.\"The proposals entitle senior managers to a redundancy package of one month's pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 months' salary or \u00a3150,000 - whichever is the lower. Lord Hall said the measures bring the BBC into greater alignment with other industry bodies and the Civil Service, who have a similar pay cap. The BBC has come under fire for the severance packages, following a number of high profile departures from the corporation in recent years. In September 2012, the former chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson left the BBC with a pay-off of \u00a3670,000, while the deputy director general Mark Byford received \u00a3949,000 when he departed in 2011. In his first appearance before the culture committee since starting in the top job at the BBC earlier this month, Lord Hall outlined his priorities for the organisation, saying there was \"too much bureaucracy\" and it had to be dealt with in \"a specific and concrete way\". He said he wanted to rebuild trust in what he called a \"remarkably creative organisation\", which needed to learn lessons from both the Pollard and Rose reviews.Lord Hall was challenged by MP Ben Bradshaw who said the fact that no senior executive was sacked after the Pollard Report - which criticised the BBC's response to the Jimmy Savile scandal - gave the impression of the existence of \"a management cadre who just look after each other\".Lord Hall said Helen Boaden, who was moved from her position as head of news after she was criticised in the report, would be \"outstanding\" in her new role as head of radio and described the move as \"appropriate\".He added that he would personally take part in the recruitment of a new editor for the flagship current affairs programme, Newsnight. The appointment to the \"phenomenally important job\" would be made in a couple of weeks, he said.Defending the broadcast of the recent Panorama programme on North Korea - in which BBC journalists filmed secretly during a study trip with 10 London School of Economics students - Lord Hall said he was \"satisfied there had been clarity over what was going on\".\"I don't want to inhibit difficult decisions being made,\" Lord Hall told the committee.\"If I had thought lives were being put at risk the programme would not have gone ahead.\"", "continent": ""},

In a televised news conference, he said Hamas has been \"hit hard\" and threatened an even tougher response should there be so much as a \"sprinkle\" of rocket fire from Gaza. Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz told the BBC's Hard Talk programme that the reoccupation of Gaza had been \"seriously considered\" during the conflict. It would be the \"only alternative\" if Hamas were to resume rocket fire into Israel, he said.  Life in Gaza was returning to normal on Wednesday, as thousands of people began returning to their homes.Engineers meanwhile struggled to repair infrastructure damaged by Israeli air strikes and shellfire.The BBC's Kevin Connolly says while the streets were packed with celebrations during the earlier hours of the ceasefire, questions are now being raised by the price that was paid for it.The beach here in Gaza is almost unrecognisable. It is busy again. There are children playing in the surf; fishermen are out tending to their nets. It is something we have not seen for a very long time.It is more than 12 hours since the ceasefire was declared. Overnight, we did not hear any shelling from Israel or any rockets being fired from Gaza. The big question is whether this ceasefire will hold. The previous eight did not, lasting for anything from a few hours to a number of days.US Secretary of State John Kerry has said the ceasefire is \"an opportunity, not a certainty\". It does not promise peace. It allows normal life to resume in Gaza. A lot of work needs to be done to ensure this is a lasting truce.In Israel, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire were silent and the military said there had been no violations of the ceasefire since it took effect.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the end of hostilities, but warned that a brighter future for civilians who have been affected depends on a sustainable truce. \"After 50 days of profound human suffering and devastating physical destruction, any violations of the ceasefire would be utterly irresponsible,\" he said.The ceasefire deal calls for the relaxing of Israeli and Egyptian border controls to allow humanitarian supplies and construction materials into Gaza, and the widening of the territory's fishing zone.Both sides have agreed to address more contentious issues - including Palestinian demands for a seaport in Gaza and the release of Hamas prisoners in the West Bank, and Israel's demand for Gaza's militants to be disarmed - at indirect talks that should begin in Cairo within a month. Israeli media reported that Mr Netanyahu had chosen not to put Egypt's ceasefire proposal to a vote in his security cabinet because of opposition from ministers who wanted to continue the offensive on Gaza.Israel launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July with the stated aim of ending rocket fire.At least 2,140 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Another 11,000 people have been injured. The Israeli authorities say 64 Israeli soldiers have been killed, along with six Israeli civilians and a Thai national. The UN says more than 17,000 buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or severely damaged, and that there are at least 475,000 internally displaced people (IDPs), more than a quarter of the territory's population.", "continent": ""},

It expressed dismay at the Committee's criticism in the face of the evidence.Mr Entwistle left the BBC in November 2012, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. His \u00a3450,000 pay-off was double the amount specified in his contract - and came with a year's health insurance and money for PR advice.A response set out by the Trust said it understood the sum was \"substantial\", but the terms reached were \"the best available in the circumstances given our contractual position\".\"The evidence we provided to the Committee clearly shows that we were not in a position where the former Director-General would have left the BBC immediately in exchange for six months' pay - \u00a3225,000.\"We provided the Committee with a copy of the Compromise Agreement reached between the former Director-General and the BBC, a summary of the events leading to this agreement and a letter from the BBC Trust's legal advisers setting out the legal reasons why the payment was appropriate.\"The Trust repeated that the only other options available to them were terminating Entwistle's contract, which would have automatically led to a 12-month pay-off, or seeking his immediate dismissal, which could have prompted a costly legal battle.In its report last month, the Public Accounts Committee said the Trust should not have agreed to pay the former director general 12-month's private medical cover or contributed to the cost of legal fees and public relations advice connected with his departure.Responding, the trust said the overall package \"was less than the director general's representatives had asked for but allowed us to conclude matters quickly, avoid any uncertainty and to focus on resolving fundamental issues of trust in BBC journalism\".The Trust denied that it had hindered parliamentary scrutiny into the proceedings by blocking an earlier NAO review of Entwistle's pay-off, reiterating that it was the Trust which had suggested a wider study of severance payments at the BBC by the National Audit Office (NAO).The conclusions of such a review could prompt a change in BBC policy, the trust said.It added that it had complied with all parliamentary requests, submitting all relevant documentation and giving evidence at the Public Accounts Committee and Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee hearings.", "continent": ""},

They were arrested after crashing their getaway car, which contained a sawn-off shotgun and ammunition.Nicol was jailed for five-and-a-half years. Fowler was given five years. The pair, who are both prisoners of HMP Addiewell in West Lothian, pleaded guilty last month to theft, robbery and firearms charges. Jailing them at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Glennie said: \"You have both pleaded guilty to a bizarre attempt to rob money from a cash machine.  \"The only saving grace in this case is that the crime was carried out in such an incompetent fashion.  \"Offences of this nature require the imposition of significant periods of custody. You will both go to prison.\"  An earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow heard how the pair stole the tanker from DPG Plus in East Kilbride at about 11:54 on 19 October. CCTV footage was shown in court of the lorry being driven into offices of HSBC in Blantyre the following night.After the ram-raid failed, the pair took turns to hit the ATM with a sledgehammer before giving up and fleeing the scene in a Skoda Octavia which had false registration plates.The car later crashed in Blantyre as it was chased by police. Officers arrested the pair after a short pursuit on foot.During a search of the Octavia police found five shotgun cartridges, a sawn-off shotgun, a quantity of tools, knives and a pair of number plates.The court also heard that HSBC had to spend \u00a3197,298 to repair the damage caused in the raid.  The owners of the sewage truck lost between \u00a340,000 and \u00a360,000 in business because of the theft. It is estimated that it will cost \u00a350,000 to replace the vehicle.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been due to attend, but cancelled the trip on Monday night after her 92-year-old mother fell ill. Mr Hague led the opening session. \"We want to widen the pool of nations and cyberusers that agree with us about the need for norms of behaviour, and who want to seek a future cyberspace based on opportunity, freedom, innovation, human rights and partnership, between government, civil society and the private sector,\" he said.However Mr Wales, who also took part in the first event, urged caution.\"The biggest threat to the internet is not cybercriminals, but misguided or overreaching government policy,\" he said.Speaking later in the day, Prime Minister David Cameron appeared to agree that politicians should resist the temptation to be heavy-handed.\"Governments must not use cyber security as an excuse for censorship,\" he said.Mrs Clinton's speech was delivered by US vice president Joe Biden. He also warned against the dangers of a \"repressive global code\".\"What citizens do online should not, as some have suggested, be decreed solely by groups of governments making decisions for them somewhere on high,\" he said via a video-link address from Washington.On Monday, Baroness Neville-Jones, the prime minister's special representative to business on cybersecurity, said Russia and China -  who are both attending the conference - were some of the worst culprits involved in cyber-attacks.And Iain Lobban, the head of GCHQ, warned that a \"significant\" attempt was made to target the computer systems of the Foreign Office and other government departments over the summer. Some reports at the time quoted intelligence sources as saying China was responsible for that attack. With cybercrime estimated to cost \u00a3600bn a year worldwide, Mr Lobban, writing in the  ahead of the summit, warned that the \"disturbing\" levels of illegal activity online represented \"a very real threat to our prosperity\".Britain said it wanted to develop a set of international \"rules of the road\", establishing \"norms of acceptable behaviour\" in cyberspace, while stopping short of a full treaty advocated by some countries.Mr Hague said a \"collective endeavour\" was needed to tap into the \"enormous potential\" of cyberspace.\"How to ensure we can all reap the benefits of a safe and secure cyberspace for generations to come is one of the greatest challenges we face,\" said Mr Hague.\"The response does not lie in the hands of any one government or country but it is too important to be left to chance. This needs to be a collective endeavour, involving all those who have a stake in cyberspace.\"The ideas and proposals we hope to emerge from the conference will develop into the 'London Agenda' - an inclusive and focused approach to help us realise the enormous potential cyberspace offers for a more prosperous, safe and open networked world.\"The government has put aside \u00a3650m of additional funding to help tackle computer-based threats over the next four years, Mr Hague added.Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said there had been a \"great growth\" in cybercrime over the past six years.As many as 5% of PCs are infected with malware - short for malicious software - Prof Anderson said, and there was a one in 20 risk that any given computer was sending spam without the owner's knowledge.\"If you want to defend against this kind of threat it's not enough to just shoot a few crocodiles, you have to drain the swamp,\" Prof Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\"We need action against the whole ecology of cybercrime, not purely defensive measures to protect, for example, the Foreign Office.\"Misha Glenny, author of Dark Market, which looks at the issue of cybercrime, said those involved were not, on the whole, engaged in traditional organised criminal activities.But he added: \"We're seeing a migration of traditional organised crime groups over into cyber, exploiting a new type of person engaged in crime who tends to be young, technically sufficient, very good at maths and physics, but perhaps not your traditional criminal figure in the outside world.\"", "continent": ""},

It took three months to complete.Whether the world needs such a garment may be a matter for debate but there is no doubting the challenge of building one. Combining a heavy Nokia 1520 with fragile materials was problematic, and there were also issues with turning them on and maintaining battery life once attached to the skirt.The phones each display different parts of an image to give the illusion of one big picture. The pictures change when the model moves, mimicking the way the tone of a fabric alters when it moves back and forth from light to shadow.Annie Kearney, from Nokia Brand Lab, says that her firm has a long history of working with fashion.\"It's a technical work of art,\" she says.\"We wanted to experiment with the possibilities between fashion and technology.\"It's so much more than a skirt made of phones, it's playing with the idea of how tech can influence and be influenced by the world around it.\"Anyone who has popped out for a spot of window shopping in their lunch hour but returned to the office laden with bags may agree that a programmable handbag that locks you out when it thinks you are overspending is a pretty good idea.The brainchild of Australian comparison site Credit Card Finder, it uses an Arduino processor and an RFID (radio-frequency identification) tag, which are mounted in the base of the bag to track your credit card spending.The bag is also fitted with a clock and can be programmed to stay closed at your most vulnerable times of day.When you enter a shopping \"danger zone\" the bag lights up with an LED warning light triggered by a GPS chip. You can also nominate a person to receive a text message if you have a spending relapse.In many ways the iBag is anti-fashion because it is all about stopping you spending. It's design could hardly be called cutting-edge either, so it is unlikely that any of the models at London Fashion Week will be carrying one.But it serves as an example of what happens when DIY technology meets fashion to solve a practical need.\"It is designed to help people who are really out of control with their spending,\" says Michelle Hutchison.The cost of the bag may trigger some warning signals of its own - at 199 Australian dollars ($179, \u00a3107) it isn't cheap. Members of the public are being asked to register interest. The firm says it will only put it into full-scale production if there is enough demand.Wearable tech hasn't yet fired up the fashion crowd's passions. Devices such as the Jawbone Up and Nike FuelBand might appeal to fitness freaks keen to track their every move but they don't exactly look great.Canadian firm Pixmob has come up with a new way of making wearable technology cool and giving  mass audience events the wow factor.At this year's Superbowl the firm supplied each of the 80,000 ticket-holders with a hat embedded with LED technology.During the halftime break the effect was quite literally a flash mob of pixels in which the audience became the light show. The hats were controlled via wireless transmitters allowing PixMob to alter the colour, brightness and pulse of the lights.At the Sochi Winter Olympics PixMob's technology was used in the opening ceremony, turning the crowd into a giant video screen via medallions around their necks.It's certainly a novel use for wearable tech and a step-up from glow sticks or waved lighters.London Fashion Week will be full of technology with models furiously tweeting each other and Instagramming from behind the scenes of the catwalk.But the fashion world is also embracing coding as part of a national push to increase the digital skills of youngsters.Last month Storm models joined young coders to develop a fashion app at an event organised by Free:Formers, a firm that organises computer-skill workshops to educate its clients.The teams created a web app for a fictional event at London Fashion Week that interacted with Facebook and the ticketing service Eventbrite. Some of the youngsters have been invited to go behind the scenes at Storm on the first day of London Fashion Week.\"I learnt about the principles of coding and I now have a general understanding of how a website can be built,\" model Stephanie Rad tells the BBC.Google Glass has already had its turn on the catwalk, when it was demoed by models at New York Fashion Week back in 2012.But most would agree that its image remains more geek than chic.In January, Google released its Titanium Collection, a set of four stylish frames for Glass with the express purpose of de-nerding the wearable to make it appeal to a wider audience.The frames can either be filled with dummy or prescription lenses.It is not the only technology firm keen to show off its style credentials. In the spring Apple will be joined by Burberry's departing chief executive Angela Ahrendts, who is set to shake up the tech firm's retail business.In the autumn Burberry used the pre-released iPhone 5S to film a catwalk show and speculation is rife as to how Ms Ahrendts will further fuse technology and fashion.", "continent": ""},

Delegates from 60 countries and 17 international organisations have converged on Westminster's QE2 Centre for two days of debate. But what is the  (and what a delightfully retro term that is) designed to achieve?After spending a few hours in the company of the delegates I am still slightly bemused. At the launch party in the Science Museum last night, the Foreign Secretary William Hague told us the conference would launch an important dialogue on the threats and opportunities of cyberspace - what he called the big Issues, \"the Vision, the Hopes, the Fears\". He told us we would be putting together the London Agenda, which would shape national and international discussions of cyberspace for years to come.But in the run-up to the conference, with the boss of GCHQ issuing dire warnings about the mounting dangers from cyber-attacks, it seemed the focus would be on the fears rather than the hopes. The conference itself is a very dark-suited middle-aged male affair, with many of the delegates coming from the security industry. The programme features a UK cyber industry showcase, with \"the latest technologies and services that UK cyber companies are developing.\" The list of companies displaying their wares is dominated by big defence and security firms - BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Qinetiq, Raytheon - and many of them have been promoting the message that cyberspace is a dangerous territory which they can help tame.So perhaps the conference is designed to come up with some new international measures to combat cybercrime or a new Geneva convention to agree some rules of engagement for cyber war fare? That was indeed the fear of a blogger who rang me at the weekend to warn that \"world governments are going to get together in London to shut down freedom on the internet!\" I tried to calm his fears, pointing out that if governments cannot even get together to sort out the euro, they will struggle to control the internet.And indeed the Foreign Office has been keen to play down expectations of real outcomes from the conference, stressing that this is just a starting-point. But this morning's opening session did offer some wider perspectives on the future of the internet. A discussion on Internet Freedom featured a Yemeni online activist, Google's head of Freedom of Expression, and John Kampfner from Index on Censorship. Mr Kampfner got straight into the dilemma facing policy makers, describing how David Cameron had been keen to shut down Blackberry during the summer riots until William Hague had pointed out just how that would play after Britain's support for the Arab Spring activist. A couple of other panel members were keen to stress the positive side of the internet, and the power it gave to individuals - and pointed out that it was often governments hacking their own people, not the other way round.So far though the overall impression at this conference is that cyberspace is a frightening and dangerous place and we need to act together to do something about it. But, apart from handing over large sums to security companies, nobody seems that clear about what concerted action would look like.

My partner may well have 40 identical pairs of black socks, accumulated from Christmasses dating back to the early 1990s.This year his mum might be persuaded to upgrade him to pair of RFID (radio frequency identification) tagged Smarter Socks.The Swedish company behind them hopes to solve the perennial problem of odd socks.Founder Samy Liechti describes them \"as something the sock world has never seen before\". Critics may argue that they are a little over-engineered.Each sock comes with its own RFID chip, which can be \"read\" by a NFC (near field communication) device known as a sock sorter, which in turn communicates via Bluetooth with an iPhone.As each pair has its own unique identifier, finding a lost pair amongst a pile of identical socks is as easier as scanning them with the sock sorter, and waiting until the iPhone app beeps to tell you it has located the exact match. \"Some cynical women may say it is the only way men can sort their socks,\" says Mr Liechti.For those who really want to keep track of their socks, the app also produces a range of data - checking how black they are, offering to replace worn-out socks and even finding a close match for socks whose partners have gone astray.Smarter Socks which comes with one Sock Sorter and ten pairs of socks, is priced at \u00a3119.No Christmas would be complete without one member of the family overdoing it on the sherry and falling asleep with their party hat at a jaunty angle.To ensure they make it home at the end of the day, how about a pair of homing shoes?English shoemaker Dominic Wilcox took his inspiration from The Wizard of Oz, for his \"No Place like Home\" shoes.Just as main character Dorothy finds her way home by clicking the heels of her red slippers, the surprisingly stylish shoes are also able to guide the wearer home.They have a GPS reader embedded in the left heel. Wearers need to plug their destination into a computer program, then upload it to the shoe using a USB cable.When out and about they just need to click their heels three times to set off internal sensors to turn on the device.An antenna disguised in a strip of fabric on the back of the shoe will connect it to GPS signals.The shoes were shown at the recent London Design Festival and Northampton's shoe museum before going off to Wired magazines annual technology exhibition/shop. \"I set out to create some shoes that I would like to wear myself, they seem to have caught the imagination of people so there may be a possibility of production in the future,\" Mr Wilcox tells the BBC. Everyone has a younger member of their family who seems to be surgically attached to their phone, checking Facebook every three seconds.So how about if they could wear their status updates on a T-shirt?The T-shirt OS started life as a promotional collaboration between whisky maker Ballantines and fashion firm Cute Circuit, which has been designing wearable technology since 2006. Wearers can upload pictures and Twitter feeds, as well as listen to music via the shirt. An Android version will come later.It is, says creative director Francesca Rosella essentially a T-shirt version of an iPhone and will, when it goes on sale next year, it likely to cost at least as much as the smartphone.The company has also made a Twitter dress, worn by pop star and X-Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger. As with the T-shirt it also offered a wearable billboard for tweets and at the launch of EE's 4G network fans were able to tweet  Ms Scherzinger, and then read their messages on her dress.It is slightly more glamorous than the T-shirt, encrusted with thousands of  Swarovski crystals and is currently a one-off design.Next year CuteCircuit is also due to launch its Hug Shirt, which is essentially a T-shirt fitted with sensors, allowing someone wearing an identical garment miles away to send a hug that can be felt by the wearer.Ok so this is not strictly clothing and as software it might be a little hard to wrap but it could still prove a thoughtful gift.Most people who have bought clothes online have experienced the frustration of them arriving and not fitting and the subsequent annoyance of having to send things back.So how about a virtual tape measure that can take accurate measurements to ensure that doesn't happen?The web-based system takes detailed measurements of the waist, hip, chest and other measurements and advises the user on which size garment to buy whenever they visit the website of a participating retailer.With funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the software is currently being developed by London College of Fashion and computer vision experts at the University of Surrey, in collaboration with body-mapping specialists Bodymetrics and digital creative agency Guided.They anticipate a launch within two years.", "continent": ""},

Just how can firms achieve the digital equivalent of a lightning strike and a maniacal screech of \"It's alive\"?Recent users of the Expressen app, of one of Sweden's leading national daily newspapers, may well have been surprised when an advert encouraged them to talk to it.They would have surely been even more surprised when the advert engaged them in a full-on conversation.According to the advert's designers, Nuance Communications, this is the first commercial example of an interactive voice advertisement.Nuance is widely believed to be behind Apple's Siri voice recognition technology (it isn't allowed to admit it though), but does confess to making Samsung's S Voice equivalent.\"An ad on a mobile device is a very inanimate thing - people don't take much notice,\" says John West, principle solutions architect at Nuance.\"If you look at adverts right now, be they mobile, print or broadcast on the web or TV, the individual stares at it, listens and possibly absorbs some of it.\"The experiments we've done so far show that if you interact with the ad through speech the recall is far stronger,\" he says.\"If you enter into a dialogue with something you become more engaged and you offer much more information because there's no clicking through or filling out forms.\"This opens all sorts of avenues to businesses that are always talking about engaging with the customer, but generally seem to be making it more difficult than ever to actually talk to them.Of course everything rides on the voice recognition actually understanding you and not, to your immense frustration, asking you to repeat yourself.Since Nuance is contractually obliged to keep the details of the advert secret and this author speaks no Swedish, this is rather difficult to test.Another of these voice adverts is being launched in the US this month, but its details too are being kept closely under wraps.\"It will involve showing you a movie based around the product,\" explains Mr West. \"It will tell a story, and ask you to make decisions that will drive the story.He admits he was originally dubious whether the company could keep people engaged in what is basically a five-minute advert.\"But actually it shows off the product much better than an advert ever could because you look at the elements of the product in the order you want.\"As things stand voice ads are limited to mobile platforms - but what if you want a physical object, like a bottle or box to perform a similar feat of animation?Companies have tried to pull this off recently using augmented reality (AR) apps such as Blippar.For example, Heinz made its logo \"Blippar-enabled\", meaning tomato ketchup fans could scan the logo on the bottle in order to view a simple recipe book.Pepsi drinkers who looked at their bottles through the app saw the label on their bottle come alive, whereupon a magician would do a magic trick.But bringing brands to life in this way has not got everyone convinced.\"The flash-and-dazzle approach is not sustainable,\" maintains Ryan Matzner, from New York-based mobile development company Fueled.\"Big brands like Heinz tend to ignore the fact that consumers are not so easily distracted these days,\" he says. \"How many people are actually willing to sit and wait while an app downloads so that they can get a recipe off a Ketchup bottle?\"Blippar, with over three million app downloads and a total of 18.5 million interactions, would answer \"lots\".Alan Parker, managing director at digital advertising consultancy Lowe Epic, cites the Ikea AR catalogue as an example of successfully implementing the technology.The Swedish flat-pack behemoth's 2014 catalogue will allow shoppers to see what its products would look like in their homes through mobile devices.\"That's genuinely of use to the consumer and does fit in with their behavioural pattern - they really do want to see what that sofa would look like in their living room,\" says Mr Parker.However, just seeing things is only the start.IBM predicts that in five years we will have the ability to \"touch\" a product through our mobile devices.Its scientists are working on using special vibration patterns to simulate touch, such as the texture and weave of a fabric.But what if an inanimate object interacts with you and you don't know it? In June, Renew London equipped recycling bins in the UK's capital with technology to track people's smartphones as they passed by. Renew fitted the devices into 12 \"pods\", which featured LCD advertising screens, to collect footfall data by logging nearby phones.The City of London Corporation , though Renew chief executive Kaveh Memari said the bins had only recorded \"extremely limited, encrypted, aggregated and anonymised data\".Nonetheless, on occasions like this, it feels a bit like time to pick up a pitchfork and flaming torch, hook up with a restless mob and send the monster back from whence it came.Sometimes, perhaps, it's better not to play digital god.", "continent": ""},

Michael Gove was heckled and jeered at the National Association of Head Teachers conference. The union passed a no confidence motion in his policies, while president Bernadette Hunter said teachers and pupils had \"never had it so bad\". But Mr Gove said he was striving for higher standards in schools.The education secretary appeared taken aback by the frosty reception as he appeared for the question and answer session on Saturday.He was told by delegates that head teachers were suffering from stress caused by his policies, by Sats tests and by the prospect of facing tough Ofsted inspections.In response to the latter, Mr Gove said: \"If you think Ofsted is causing you fear I am grateful for your candour, but we are going to have to part company.\"At which point, a delegate shouted: \"Are you leaving then?\"Mr Gove looked visibly ruffled during the session which was repeatedly punctuated by ironic laughter and groans at his responses.One head teacher, Denise Wells, from Field House Infants school in Derbyshire, said colleagues felt they were living under a culture of \"bullying and fear\" as they waited for Ofsted inspectors to arrive.Another, Lesley Wells, from Burton on Trent in Staffordshire, described how one of her school governors with 20 years experience had \"dissolved into tears\" after a week in which her school dealt with both Sats and an Ofsted visit.She said as a head teacher she expected to face pressure but she did not think it was right that someone who had given 20 years of voluntary service should.Mr Gove told delegates he had been \"delighted with the warmth and enthusiasm\" that had greeted some of the government's education policies.He admitted that he may have not communicated his vision of the education system well enough, but said that while he had been \"chastened by criticism\" in the past, there would be no change of course.\"If people find it stressful that I'm demanding higher standards,\" the education secretary said to audible groans from the hall, \"then I'm not going to stop demanding higher standards.\"At the end of the session he said: \"What I have heard is repeated statements that the profession faces stress, and insufficient evidence about what can be done about it...\"What I haven't heard over the last hour is a determination to be constructive, critical yes, but not constructive.\"Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, told the BBC afterwards it had been \"a fairly bruising session\".\"It's not because it is a hard job - the job of a head teacher should be tough - but what I think he's failed to pick up on is the short termism of the targets and the constant change, [which] means that people no longer feel that they're doing the job that they came to do, which is to teach children.  \"Instead, they're bombarded by a flood of what they see as very poorly thought through initiatives and I think that is where the unhappiness comes from.\"Earlier, the NAHT joined the three biggest teaching unions in England and Wales in formally opposing government education policy. It is the first head teachers' union to pass a no confidence motion. It is critical because it is head teachers who will have to implement the government's school plans.The stance represents a stepping up of their conflict with ministers and follows on from test boycotts and industrial action. The union is particularly critical of what it describes as \"forced academisation\" in which struggling schools are encouraged to convert to become state-funded independent schools instead of remaining part of their local education authority.The Department for Education argues this is the best way forward for an underperforming school.But heads say that academy \"brokers\" employed by the Department for Education (DfE) are using unsavoury methods to push primary schools into opting out of their links with local authorities.A DfE spokeswoman said: \"Academy brokers help us to identify the best possible sponsor to turn around failing schools and ensure pupils are given every chance to fulfil their potential.\"We expect the highest levels of professional conduct from academy brokers and any allegations of misconduct are fully investigated.\" The NAHT is the biggest union for head teachers, representing 85% of primary heads and 40% of secondary heads in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Stephen Twigg, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: \"David Cameron and Michael Gove need to change course. They are damaging school standards by undermining teachers.\"It's no wonder given they are allowing unqualified teachers into our classrooms, teacher morale is at an all time low and 6,000 qualified teachers have left the profession on their watch.\"", "continent": ""},

The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, \"musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else,\" says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group.The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; \u00a3945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a \"crowdfunding cafe\" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship.\"I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together,\" he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts.\"It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future,\" she says.Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa.\"So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting,\" says Ms Constant.But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. \"When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter.\"There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel.\"With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD.On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer.For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things.But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet?Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges.  \"Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access\u2026 so that really isn't the constraint,\" Mr Goldstuck says.\"The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity.\"Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change.He calls crowdfunding \"funds with benefits\" and says it \"allows us to make the world as we would like it\". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, \"music is not something that relies on musicians only.\"I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen.\"So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen.\"", "continent": ""},

What form should this overhaul take?Acting director general Tim Davie needs to say something very soon about Newsnight and its future. I wonder if the brand continues and there is an investigative report on the programme, will people trust it? He needs to lay out a road map for the radical overhaul of BBC management. I don't think the BBC can wait three months for a new director general for this to take place. The new director general needs to come from outside, just for perception. They need to be a heavyweight who can really shake the BBC up and deliver uncomfortable change to very senior people. But it's hard to think of an outstanding candidate.They need a deputy. We need to have one person running the BBC, as with any organisation it needs a boss. But a deputy director general could be in charge of journalism, effectively fulfilling the role of editor-in-chief. They would support the director general, be out in public taking some of the flack. This was part of George Entwistle's undoing - he was the only one able to do press conferences and interviews and that clearly took its toll. Firstly, the BBC needs to sort out its journalism. Secondly, the corporation needs to make sure it has the right people and the right systems to deal with a crisis. Thirdly, the BBC needs to act firmly, but fairly on the outcome of the various reports it's commissioned into what went wrong. Next, and in a slightly longer time scale, the BBC needs to implement the \"thorough and radical changes\" in management structure and culture promised by the chairman [of the BBC Trust], Lord Patten.Some of these, like the separation of the roles of director general and editor-in-chief need a change to the BBC's Charter but there's no reason why, in the mean time, the new DG shouldn't have someone at their side to oversee journalism. The BBC's governance structure must also change. Self-regulation doesn't work. It is not possible for the Trust to be regulator, cheerleader, defender of the BBC's independence and ultimate performance manager at the same time. A more normal board structure to \"manage and challenge\" would work better with regulation done independently by Ofcom. Lastly, the BBC should do less and focus resources on what it does best. Programmes like Newsnight have been starved of money, its journalists repeatedly asked to do more for less. In the end quality suffers.Above all, the BBC needs a strong and effective leader. The BBC is an incredibly large and complex organisation which is really loved by the British public. There is no proof it is ungovernable, the previous director general-but-one, Mark Thompson, seemed to manage ok and there is no reason a vigorous and active leader can't do the same.They need to get the person at the top right and not worry so much about the structure. That said, that person needs to be well-supported. They need a powerful and effective support cast.They need to find a good troubleshooter. You can have good intentions and plans, but as George Entwistle found, you won't often survive the first contact with the enemy and running the BBC is most definitely a contact sport.They will also need a deputy, like the role Mark Byford used to fill, with the ability in particular to oversee the vast journalistic output as news is time-consuming and has the capacity to be very controversial. This job shouldn't not be conducted by the same person running the whole corporation, who is making decisions on strategy and finance.In the past 50 years, crises like this have engulfed the BBC periodically. These things come and go. The BBC has a worldwide reputation for producing good programmes, and has global reach in its news gathering and commentary on current affairs. In the UK many cherish its output.At home, as often is the case for important institutions, there are also plenty of critics. Some think that in an age of media proliferation a state funded broadcaster levying a tax on every TV set-user is no longer needed or appropriate. Others think there is a role for public service broadcasting, but it is a smaller role with a narrower range of programmes than the BBC currently produces.  The BBC needs to answer its critics in the best possible way, by producing great programmes and unbiased news and commentary. There is no need to abolish Newsnight, every need to raise its standards of journalism. The BBC needs a new editor-in-chief who works to raise those standards and eliminate more of the perceived biases. It also needs less expensive management floating above the editors and producers who need to be responsible for their programmes. As a public service broadcaster it has to offer better value for money, which means less and less expensive management. It needs to offer something for everyone on the hotly disputed issues of the day, rather than implying these disputes have been settled with one side winning. Jeremy Paxman says Newsnight's problem with journalistic ethics arose because the show has become under-resourced. But Newsnight's problems were twofold. There was clearly a failure of basic journalistic standards by journalists working on the north Wales care home scandal. Moreover, it looks like no-one further up the management chain actually reviewed the core thesis, its research background, and the finished product. Resources are irrelevant to both those problems. The reputation of BBC News rests on the quality of its journalism, which in turn rests on the ethics and sense of principled responsibility of its journalists.The BBC should have an internal alert system for when any part of the news arm makes allegations as serious as those Newsnight levelled at Lord McAlpine and it should be compulsory for senior executives to regularly review major BBC news stories. The new director general should take personal responsibility for the BBC's ethics, seek to renew the BBC's culture of public service, and ensure that bureaucratic entropy does not shield the organisation from that responsibility, which is to the public as a whole.The BBC is working in a protected environment because of its funding, so if it's not careful it can start to operate within its own bubble. The structure of the BBC needs a complete overhaul. This must not be a tinkering exercise. The mistakes made by Newsnight highlight issues that would have been covered in the first couple of weeks of any of the BJTC-accredited courses. Newsnight forgot the golden rules of checking - and that's a sign of operation in isolation.The BBC must get back to its roots as a public service broadcaster, create a sensible chain of news command and stop ratings-chasing. They're given licence fee money to prevent that happening, but it's being used to ensure it does.The Newsnight mess and the This Morning debacle are both prime examples of a worrying new broadcasting arrogance borne out of a frustration that websites, blogs and posts can create waves daily without the risk of regulatory wrath.Internet \"news\" is regularly being reported by the traditional broadcast media with a cavalier disregard for the level of responsibility viewers and listeners are entitled to expect. It's not just Leveson, broadcast regulation needs a good look at.What the BBC does not need now is another committee or two to approve, check or anticipate journalistic output.It needs to free up its journalists and unblock the news arteries while at the same time ensure that journalists are held fully responsible when they get it wrong - not merely moved to a less controversial area of coverage.What the general public probably does not appreciate is that by comparison with much of the written press, the broadcast media is heavily regulated and under intense scrutiny.During my time as a spin doctor at the Liberal Democrats I would always get a thoughtful response for any complaints I had against the BBC. Let's also not forget that appointing a new boss at the BBC under some delusion that the new person will be able to monitor the output of every potentially controversial piece of journalism and prevent any future errors is utterly absurd. The whole point is to put the responsibility for the decision making squarely on the shoulders of those making the programmes and the journalists who will pay the price if they get it wrong. More regulation has rarely led to better decision making and in the fast moving world of journalism it would mean the slow death of a great institution. ", "continent": ""},

Zapacab became South Africa's first cab hailing mobile platform, when it launched in August.\"People are using their phones in smarter and smarter ways,\" says Rupert Sully, founder of Zapacab.He says the amount of Zapacab users from different demographics is \"testimony to this wave that's growing in Africa at the moment, this upsurge of technology, particularly in mobile\".Snappcab launched shortly after. Its managing director Anton van Metzinger says safety is of paramount importance: \"It's about efficiency. It's about safety.\" Snappcab tells passengers the driver's name and also allows a commuter to know what their driver and the car look like. The app also allows the commuter to contact the driver directly and plot the driver's headway on a map on their smartphone. The entire trip is on record with Snappcab, providing an extra sense of security and preventing dodgy detours from taking place. Zapacab's Mr Sully says that their drivers are preselected and have received some training, but there are challenges, as introducing the app is not just a \"plug and play\" process.\"They [the drivers] are very comfortable with the whole concept that these markets are becoming more tech-savvy, but just to teach them how to use smartphone interfaces that we place in their cars, is a unique challenge.\" Teaching the drivers how to use the app is not the only challenge that the local app creators face. They also face competition from global giants such as Uber, which launched in South Africa earlier this month. Uber states that it's \"everyone's private driver\", it caters to upmarket commuters who want to be chauffeured in luxury cars such as the BMW 7 series and Mercedes Benz S550s and has a presence in around 50 cities worldwide. However, the local firms feel that their apps are tailored for South Africans, and therefore they have an advantage.Mr Sully says that Uber \"is not necessarily custom-made for the needs here\".\"It's not just about replicating things that work elsewhere, it's trying to find out what works here,\" he states.But Uber's international launcher, Patrick Studener, responds that even though Uber is a global brand, it has localised its product to cater to the South African market and is doing very well in the country.\"We don't fly people in from San Francisco to run South Africa. We have South Africans working in South Africa,\" he says.\"We do tackle every problem as it comes locally, and we have local community managers, we have local operations managers who look after the local community and that's the model to making it work locally.\" Uber also stresses that it was important to come to South Africa because Africa is a \"great emerging market space\". While Snappcab and Zapacab cater to cab commuters, many South Africans actually travel by minibus taxi, bus and train. The Innovation Hub has funded Snappcab and various other mobile platforms that aim to revolutionise the transportation space, like Go Metro for train users and Afta Robot for mini bus taxi commuters. Gary Bannatyne, incubation business development manager at the Innovation Hub says that there's a huge push for ICT development in the transportation service sector because technology is the only way forward.\"Technology is crucial, mobile technology is very crucial in the transport space and it's a huge focus of ours to enable these guys who have the solutions in that space.\"And the local firms who are making their name in that transport space have ambitions beyond South Africa's borders.Both Zapacab and Snappcab have plans to expand further into Africa.As Zapacab's Mr Sully puts it, their expansion ambitions \"really show how technology can go beyond borders to influence the way our markets interact with each other\".\"[That] really says a lot about how technology is playing out on this continent.\"", "continent": ""},

Tony Hall is the right person to lead this.\"He went on: \"Tony Hall has been an insider and is a currently an outsider. \"As an ex-BBC man he understands how the corporation's culture and behaviour make it, at its best, the greatest broadcaster in the world. \"And from his vantage point outside the BBC, he understands the sometimes justified criticisms of the corporation - that it can be inward-looking and on occasions too institutional.\"But perhaps most importantly, given where we now find ourselves, his background in news will prove invaluable as the BBC looks to rebuild both its reputation in this area and the trust of audiences.\"Lord Hall said: \"This organisation is an incredibly important part of what makes the United Kingdom what it is.

He is believed to have been on the final shortlist for the director general post in 1999 when Greg Dyke was appointed.He began his job at the Royal Opera House in 2001.In 2009 he joined the board of the organising committee for the London Olympics and also set up and chaired the board of the Games' arts festival, the Cultural Olympiad.He was made a cross-bench peer in 2010 as Lord Hall of Birkenhead.Lord Hall, who is currently deputy chairman of Channel 4 and sits on the board of the British Council, will be standing down from these roles before he takes up the post of director general.At the Royal Opera House, Lord Hall has won praise for turning around the business's fortunes. He has widened access to productions through nationwide big screen relays and the purchase of a DVD company to distribute recordings globally. Turnover is reported to have risen from about \u00a345m to \u00a3106m under his tenure. Simon Robey, of the Royal Opera House's board of trustees, said: \"I can think of nobody better able to bring stability back to the BBC...

Mr Twigg said this was a \"real and growing threat to school standards\".But the Department for Education said his claims were \"ridiculous\".Mr Twigg's comments come less than two weeks after the National Audit Office warned that a quarter of a million extra school places would be needed in England by autumn 2014.The spending watchdog said one in five primary schools in England was full or near capacity and there were signs of \"real strain\" on places.Labour says its calculations, based on pupil population estimates, show around 14,545 teachers are needed. When this is added to the 520 vacancies the party says are already in the system, it means that around 15,065 teachers will be required by the next election. Addressing the ATL's conference in Liverpool on Wednesday, Mr Twigg said: \"Michael Gove is presiding over a crisis in the teaching profession - with a huge shortage of teachers, and unqualified teachers getting into the classroom. \"Pupils deserve far better. Unless this crisis is addressed head on, pupils will be in bigger class sizes or face being taught by people without teaching qualifications.\"This is a real and growing threat to school standards.\"All the international evidence shows that the quality of teaching makes the biggest difference to results. We cannot let the next generation down by cutting teacher quality.\"Mr Twigg criticised the education secretary for allowing free schools and academies the freedom to employ staff who do not have qualified teacher status.Mr Twigg also hit out at the government, saying it has \"pitched itself against\" the teaching profession, \"against the very people it needs onside to deliver the sort of change that our education system needs\".Mr Twigg said politicians have a duty \"not to undermine the professionalism that underpins the status and morale of teachers\".\"Heads, teachers and the wider school workforce are the people who make the biggest difference to our children's educational outcomes. \"All too often they are undermined by politicians and a media obsessed with talking down our education system.\"A minister would not instruct a surgeon on best practice in an operating theatre, yet, all too often, ministers want to prescribe methods for the delivery of teaching and learning in our classrooms.\"A Department of Education spokesperson said: \"Teaching is a highly attractive profession - more top graduates and career changers than ever before are coming into teaching, and vacancy rates are at their lowest since 2005. \"Teacher training applications for fee-based postgraduate courses in England are up by more than 1,500 applicants on this time last year. \"We have invested \u00a34m to help existing teachers develop their skills.

That is why we have given free schools and academies the same freedoms the best independent schools enjoy to hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and others who can inspire their pupils.\"On Tuesday, Liberal Democrat Schools Minister David Laws praised the teaching profession, saying ministers \"appreciate the job you do - genuinely and sincerely.\"", "continent": ""},

If so, spare a thought for the legions of often small, young, entrepreneurial companies that will want to sell you a case, a bag, fancy headphones, a docking device and possibly even a specially adapted pillow to go with it.  Welcome to the rough-and-tumble world of the technology accessory-makers.   It is a trade that lives or dies on having something relevant or - even better, new - to sell every time a major brand such as Apple or Samsung launches a new product.  Knomo is a good case study of the intense pressures all accessory-makers face.\"Crucial to being successful is that you are in the market very quickly,\" says Howard Harrison, founder and chief executive of the company that supplies upmarket leather cases, bags and sleeves, mainly for Apple devices.\"If you delay even three or four weeks to launch an accessory after the device has been launched\u2026 most of the retailers will have gone elsewhere to find other options,\" Mr Harrison says. The comment particularly applies to the part of Knomo's business focused on \"form-fitted\" products: goods designed to exactly match a particular model of gadget.\"More than 50% of the business for a form-fitted accessory is done within three months of a product being launched,\" Mr Harrison says.With a selling season this short, Knomo needs to make sure its accessories are designed, made and procured in bulk well ahead of the product launch to which they are linked.That is no easy task given the secrecy that surrounds the launch plans of Apple, and to a lesser extent the other big tech brands.Knomo must create accessories to match products it has not seen, sometimes before it knows for sure that they even exist.    It is a high-stakes game in which big bets are made.The nightmare scenario is producing a form-fitted leather case where, say, the hole for the headphones or the space for the volume control is too small or in the wrong place.Knomo goes to great lengths to make sure it is not caught out.  \"We get our information from 20 to 30 different sources,\" Mr Harrison says. \"We use all the intelligence we can possibly gather.\"Sources include continuously checking the latest rumours on technology websites, as well as conversations with the company's suppliers and distributors around the world.   Mr Harrison will not be drawn on whether Knomo has informants at the factories of Chinese suppliers to the big technology brands. So far, he says, the company has only got it wrong once and then not very seriously.Knomo seems to be flourishing despite the pressures.It began as \"one man in a room\", as Mr Harrison puts it, nine years ago.  Now the company has an annual turnover of \u00a310m ($16m) and employs 25 people, with its main office in a trendy part of the West End of London and sales in 35 countries.Breffo, another small technology accessory-maker based in the UK, also has to cope with the uncertainties of the major brands' launch cycles.Its solution is unusual in an industry where it is almost taken for granted that products will be manufactured in China or elsewhere in Asia.Everything Breffo sells is made in Britain.Patrick Mathews, its founder and managing director, says it is quicker and more flexible to manufacture near home and it gives him much more control. He also argues that the costs are much the same because the manufacturing process he uses is highly automated.  \"If there's any labour in the manufacturing process, you get the costs associated with it,\" he says. \"However, in automated production there's no additional cost [from making things in the UK]. As a result, we're able to beat the prices offered in China.\"The company was founded in 2010 and now has a turnover of \u00a31m ($1.6m), with offices in Britain and the US.Its main product is the Spiderpodium, an ingenious device designed to grip and hold a smartphone or tablet to any kind of surface.It has eight legs made of flexible steel coated with rubber.Mr Mathews came up with the idea during a long flight.The in-flight entertainment system was broken, so he watched a movie on his iPhone and found it uncomfortable having to hold the handset in front of his face for several hours.  The Spiderpodium, which now comes in several sizes, was born from his irritation at not being able to fix his phone to the back of the seat in front of him. The product has sold well, but that has brought its own difficulties.Mr Mathews says he is aware of several factories in China that churn out poor-quality imitations of his products and sell them pretending to be Breffo.That is a problem because it loses him sales.But more seriously, perhaps, it threatens to undermine the image of the brand.Customers and suppliers often do not realise they are being sold counterfeit goods, he says, so the blame for any defects ends up at his door.Mr Mathews says he is frustrated by seeing complaints about Breffo appearing on review websites that are entirely due to the shoddy workmanship of fake products being sold under his brand name. On one occasion he challenged a Chinese company, which he believed was misusing his brand name.   It advised him to get in touch with its UK operation.  The contact it gave him, he says, was his own address.Being in the technology accessories business, it seems, is not a ticket to an easy life.", "continent": ""},

The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the \"Ferguson\" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute. Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.  Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.  The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to \"convert [passengers] to internet users\".  But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers. \"We get more passengers,\" says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. \"They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi.\" Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub. It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to . The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (\u00a3365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution. While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow. Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning \"silicon savannah\" techies, it's an opportunity.\"Commutes can be up to three hours long,\" says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. \"That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used.\"Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles. Yet advertising alone can be boring. \"If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them,\" explains Mr Gordon. \"We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics.\" For example, in April they asked riders on selected buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus. The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as \"Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz\u2026\" \"People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic,\" says Mr Gordon, \"so it's a win win.\" It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues. However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making. As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor. While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone. Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction. The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection.\"Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation\u2026 and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure,\" says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to \"simplify payments\", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets. \"Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based.\"Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety. The  estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year. One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of \"unsafe forms of public transportation\". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers.\"What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece,\" says Simon Kimutai of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya. For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as \"stand up and speak up\" against bad driving. The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: \"Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best.\"", "continent": ""},

Official forecasts earlier this year showed an extra 450,000 places would be needed in England by 2015.Infant classes - reception, years one and two  - are for children aged from four to seven. In most cases, the over-sized classes have been legally expanded above the 30 pupil limit.Schools are allowed to waive the limit when families move to an area mid-year and no other places can be found near them; if the parents have won a place after an appeal or if a child is admitted because of their special educational needs.Recent changes also mean schools can do so to let in twins or children of members of the armed forces.In nearly half of cases this year when an infant class was lawfully expanded, it was because of an appeal decision. The next most common reason was children being admitted outside the normal admission time.   The  \n          \n also show average class sizes and these are 27 children per class both in infant and junior classes in England's primary schools. In state-funded secondary schools, the average is 20. \n        Separate figures have shown there are many unfilled primary school places in England - more than 444,000 - either where parents are shunning unpopular schools or local child numbers are falling.In Scotland, the average class size for infants is 22 - and 23 for primary classes overall. Earlier this year, Sutton Council in London called on the government to lift the limit on infant class sizes, saying this would help deal with the shortage of primary school places. London and Birmingham are among the areas facing the biggest shortages. More schools and classrooms are being built there and in other hot-spots across the country.Labour set the legal limit on infant class sizes in 1998.  The shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"We have seen that Michael Gove is going back to the future on exams - they are doing the same on class sizes.\"Under a Labour government, the numbers of pupils in infant classes larger than 30 fell dramatically - a key pledge in our 1997 manifesto.\"The Department for Education said most classes with more than 30 pupils had been expanded lawfully, for sensible reasons.A spokeswoman said: \"The average class size at state-funded primary schools has increased by 0.1 percentage points, but the average class size in state-funded secondary schools has remained the same and the numbers of unlawfully large classes in infant schools has decreased dramatically\".\"We are more than doubling targeted investment at areas facing the greatest pressure on numbers - to over \u00a34 billion in the next four years. \"We are also building Free Schools and letting the most popular schools expand to meet demand from parents and we are intervening to drive up standards in weak primaries across the country which have thousands of empty places simply because parents don't want to send their children to them.\"", "continent": ""},

In Birmingham, the birth rate rose by 25% between 2000 and 2007.But within this average, there are wards with a primary-age population projected to rise by more than 50% and others where there is zero increase expected.In response to such local pressures, there are plans for Nansen Primary in Birmingham to expand from 630 pupils to 1,260 - which means moving to six forms per year group.There have been many different local proposals to finding enough space for extra pupils - including temporary classrooms, converting empty shops, developing split-site schools and in Barking there was a suggestion for pupils using a building in different shifts.But it is also putting pressure on parental choice.In response, Tower Hamlets in east London is considering changes to its admissions policy for next year, including a system which would recognise how far children would have to travel to their next available place if local schools were full up.It also means a distinct change in the image of a typical primary school.Between 1950 and 2010, the average size of a primary school in the UK remained relatively constant, in a narrow range between 180 and 220 pupils.There were also 5,500 more primary schools in the early 1970s, when there was last such a demand for places.David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, says much bigger primary schools are now going to become \"less unusual\".But Mr Simmonds, deputy leader of Hillingdon Council, is confident that local authorities will be able to cope with the pressure.The decision to expand existing schools in urban areas, where land is scarce and expensive, is often the most practical way of creating more places, he says. In rural and suburban areas, there might be more opportunity for new schools.The response of parents can vary, he says, in what is an \"emotive\" subject.Parents wanting to get children into an oversubscribed school might welcome the creation of more places - while those at the school might be less enthusiastic about such major changes to pupil numbers.There can also be practical questions such as parking congestion around schools, he says.The response from parents to previous stories on the BBC News website also shows that there are supporters of bigger schools - with emails arguing that they provide the capacity for more activities, sports and specialist staff.Head teachers' leader Russell Hobby backed the expansion of existing schools as the best response to the places shortage.\"However, there are limits to how far a primary can grow and still retain the ethos that makes it special and welcoming to young children. Primary heads are more than capable of handing the logistics, but it is the culture and pastoral care that are at issue,\" said Mr Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers.\"Primaries can run well at 500 or even 700 pupils, but then you're stretching it.\"The shortage of primary places also runs across political fault lines.Local authorities have a responsibility to ensure enough places - but the government has a \"presumption\" that new schools should be free schools or academies, outside of local authority control.This has raised questions about whether the political investment in free schools is at odds with the strategic need to meet the demand for places.Mr Simmonds, a Conservative, says councils should work with potential free school providers and that there should not be any delays as a result.But he says it is clear that tackling this places shortage is going to be a priority.\"For the next five years, almost all the capital spending will be on primary places,\" he said.A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We're creating thousands more places to deal with the impact of soaring birth rates on primary schools. We're more than doubling targeted investment at areas facing the greatest pressure on numbers - over \u00a34billion in the next four years.\"No-one is saying it will be easy balancing demand for places with retaining the sort of character and ethos that parents want. Our job is to put the capital and the policies to help councils and schools to make the right decisions.\"", "continent": ""},

Words are sometimes better than pictures, particularly if you don't want to keep stopping to look at your smartphone.\" As digital maps can now be linked to an almost infinite number of data sets, he argues, they are going to become more personalised.\"Anglers or cyclists, say, will be able to add whatever information is relevant to them.\" he says.Not only does geo-location help us know where we are and what there is of interest around us, it can show us where everyone else is too, and what they think is useful and interesting. Maps are becoming social. Israeli company Waze, bought by Google in June, is incorporating live updates from its community of users to give commuters tips on how to avoid snarl-ups and roadworks. The static 2D map has become 4D - updating itself in real time. As you drive, your GPS-enabled smartphone shows you all the other Waze drivers in your vicinity. You receive real-time alerts from fellow drivers, and hopefully enjoy a less frustrating journey as a result. In my area of Greenwich, Waze tells me over 1,500 drivers drove 105,000 miles, posted and shared 528 road alerts, and made 19 map improvements in the last week alone. Other geo-location apps, such as FourSquare, Tinder and Here On Biz, all incorporate mapping of some kind.Of course, crowdsourcing data works better the more people take part, and the data often cannot be independently verified, but such services can improve the accuracy of maps to the benefit of all. Research consultancy Oxera says more than one billion hours of travel time and 3.5 billion litres of fuel are saved globally each year due to improved navigation, while the advantages of more accurate, dynamically-updated maps for national emergency services are obvious. Ordnance Survey uses 3D aerial imagery, coupled with laser technology that can measure the heights of buildings and landscape topography, to create highly-precise 3D models of cities and towns. Its core digital mapping database contains over 460 million geographic features and usually receives 10,000 updates every day.But some think there is still room for improvement. For example, Chris Sheldrick's start-up company What3Words.com has divided up the globe into 57 trillion 3m by 3m squares, each identified by a unique combination of three randomly generated words.\"When I was in the music event business I kept telling people where a gig was but a number of people would always get lost\", he says. \"The postcode system just wasn't accurate enough, particularly in rural areas.\"His system bridges the gap between postcodes and accurate-but-complicated GPS co-ordinates, he argues. Users can also buy a single word to represent the precise location, making addresses even simpler to remember, he says.What3Words' platform is being used by Australian emergency services, says Mr Sheldrick, and he envisages great potential in the rural expanses of Africa and the Middle East, where street addresses often don't exist.The global geoservices market is worth between \u00a398 billion and \u00a3177 billion a year, according to Oxera, making it about four times the size of the video game industry. About 90% of OS's business is now digital, even though it still sells 2.5 million paper maps a year. Better maps mean better business. \"Suppose you're a restaurant chain that wants to know where they should build next\", says Urban Mapping's Ian White.\"They may want to target a certain demographic, income profile, population density and visualise this on a map showing transport links and how many people could reach this destination in a given time. \"We can do this and help businesses make better decisions.\"He foresees a time when commercial quadcopter drones equipped with cameras and a host of sensors will be able to map buildings' CO2 output almost in real time. This could, for example, enable authorities to tax companies very precisely according to the size of their carbon footprint.But the explosion of digital information - 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years, says the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London - presents its own challenges. \"Big data offers multiple possibilities\", says Mr White. \"But the dirty secret no-one talks about is that a lot of this data is junk. Governments are rushing to put data online without checking the accuracy of that data.\"It all needs to be \"curated\", he argues.While the proliferation of data and new interaction technologies are making maps richer, more dynamic and immersive, there is still one underlying theme that unites all maps throughout history: location.We will always need to know where we are in the world.", "continent": ""},

Local authorities have a legal duty to provide places for children, but are facing many changes in the organisation and creation of schools.Some saw their plans for new schools or the re-building of existing ones scrapped with the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future programme, which the coalition said was too expensive and bureaucratic.Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Stephen Twigg said: \"Today's figures confirm the crisis in primary places in England. Many schools are at breaking point with pupils potentially being taught in warehouses and empty shops. \"Labour have been warning the government for months about the huge shortfall in places. \"But instead of addressing this crisis head on, the government has slashed the capital budget by nearly two thirds and are creating free schools, many of which are in areas where there isn't a demand for extra places or from parents.\" ", "continent": ""},

Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies. It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time.  \"We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies,\" says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer.  \"We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers,\" he continues, \"Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications.\"It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.  Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.  Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.   But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers. Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.  To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.  But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes. The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use. The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.  The waste products are heat and harmless water. Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.     The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years. Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.       To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a \"liquid catalyst\" composed of \"a dissolved solution of metal salts\".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a \"regenerator\".\"We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost,\" says Mr Bilton.  The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.  Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented \"FlowCath\" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.  The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.  Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised \u00a315m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.  It is currently hoping to raise another \u00a315m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.        Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings. Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers. It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.         The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims? Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment.\"The core technology looks very exciting,\" he says.\"There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it,\" Prof Brandon adds.  It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy. The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines. But there are also significant snags. Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages. Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.  Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.  Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.    ", "continent": ""},

Waltham Forest and Barking and Dagenham get nearly \u00a330m each.Government figures show more than 450,000 extra primary pupils will need places in England by 2015, as schools face a surging birth rate.It is thought that number will rise to around 800,000 by 2020. The allocation list, published by the DfE on Wednesday, sees four London borough at the top - Brent (\u00a330.9m), Waltham Forest (\u00a329.9m), Barking and Dagenham (\u00a329.88m) and Redbridge (\u00a323.4m).The City of Bristol is next with an allocation of \u00a322.8m, followed by Newham (\u00a322.4m), Hammersmith and Fulham (\u00a318.75m), Hounslow (\u00a316.7m) and Lewisham (\u00a316m).A DfE spokeswoman said: \"In spite of the challenging economic climate, we have doubled the annual funding previously available to help create new school places.  \"Funding is targeted at areas where the pressures of soaring birth rates are being felt the most and allocations are based on information that local authorities provide.\"We plan to announce future funding allocations for school places at the end of this year.\"But Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg said the announcement revealed nothing new. \"Any funding to address the shortage in primary places is welcome but this is money that was announced by the Chancellor in the Autumn Statement in November. \"Michael Gove is fooling nobody into thinking that he is taking the shortage in primary school places seriously. \"The education secretary failed to get a fair capital spending allocation for the Department for Education at the Comprehensive Spending Review, receiving one of the biggest capital spending reductions, at twice the average of all other government departments, ending the primary building programme.\" ", "continent": ""},

Yet most of these deaths could be avoided by simply keeping them warm.\"A new-born baby wailing can generally be heard outside the room - even across the hallway. But not my baby. Mine can only whimper,\" says Jayalakshmi Devi. She's standing outside the neo-natal intensive care unit (ICU) staring at the glass box where her baby son is kept.Born too soon, her baby boy weighs less than 1.2 pounds (0.54kgs). Doctors have given him around a 40% chance of survival.Having lost two babies already, Jayalakshmi didn't want to take a chance this time. After delivering her child in a rural healthcare centre three hours outside Bangalore, she brought the baby to the state run hospital in the city. At Vanivilas hospital, the neo-natal ICU sees scores of premature babies. Most are born at home, in far off rural areas and are brought here in critical condition.Row after row, the transparent boxes create warmth to hold the tiny, bare-bodied babies with only an oversized diaper around them. Some of the babies are small enough to fit into your palm. A baby's body temperature drops as soon as it is outside the controlled environment of the mother's womb. So just after labour, it's important to regulate the temperature.But premature babies have very little body fat, so they are unable to do that. The babies need incubators to help keep them alive - equipment which state-run hospitals like this one often cannot afford. So, GE Healthcare created the Lullaby baby-warmer, to help to save lives in a country that has the highest rate of pre-term baby deaths in the world.It was developed in Bangalore and launched in 2009. The baby warmer costs $3,000 (\u00a31,900) in India, 70% cheaper than traditional models.The design includes pictorial warnings and colour coding, so that even illiterate rural healthcare workers can operate the machine.The Lullaby warmer also consumes less power than most incubators, which means cost savings for the healthcare centre.\"Where better to make a baby warmer than here - India produces a baby nearly every second,\" says GE Healthcare's Ravi Kaushik.He believes India is an ideal innovation centre when it comes to products like this, because 70% of the population is rural and 30% is urban, and within this you all different stratas of society.\"So you can have very great world class hospitals that want and require world class medical equipment that America or Europe would require. But at the same time there is a population in rural space that would require same kind of medical attention,\" says Mr Kaushik. \"So when you design a product, you have to cater to the entire plethora of needs. That allows you to almost hit the entire world because India is a small representation of that.\" Engineers at GE's technology centre are stripping down lifesaving, high tech medical devices of all their frills to understand how to create products that are affordable. This project is now widely quoted as an example of \"reverse innovation\". This is where large global companies design products in developing markets like India and then take the successful creation back to international markets to sell.After success in the domestic market, GE now sells the warmer in more than 80 countries.While this works for healthcare centres on a budget, it still needs continuous electricity to run.But go further down the population pyramid, and the problems get more complex.Women in villages give birth at home and have little access to basic healthcare or electricity.For them, keeping babies warm means wrapping them in layers of fabric and hot water bottles, or putting them under bare light bulbs. Many of them don't survive. But now a low cost baby bag is saving thousands of young lives. Called the Embrace, it emerged out of a class assignment at Stanford's Institute of Design in 2007. Four graduate students - Jane Chen, Linus Liang, Naganand Murty, and Rahul Panicker - were challenged to come up with a low-cost incubator design that could help save premature babies born into poverty.The team created a sleeping bag with a removable heating element. Using high school physics, they used phase-change material (PCM), a waxy substance that, as it cools from melted liquid to solid, maintains the desired temperature of 37 degrees celsius (98.6 F) for up to six hours.The end product looks like a quilted sleeping bag that is durable and portable. It requires only 30 minutes of electricity to warm up using a portable heater that comes with the product.More importantly for mothers, it allows for increased contact with their child, unlike traditional incubators.So it also encourages Kangaroo care, a technique practiced on newborn, especially pre-term infants, which promotes skin-to-skin contact to keep the baby warm and facilitate breastfeeding and bonding.The infant warmer costs about $200 to make, is inexpensive to distribute, and is reusable.Embrace is a non-profit venture. The product is not sold, but is donated to impoverished communities in need.The invention is thought to have helped save the lives of more than 22,000 low birth-weight and premature infants.Taking the programme forward, the organisation has developed a new version designed for at-home use by mothers. The model has been successfully prototyped and is currently undergoing clinical testing in India.The organisation has also set up educational programmes to address the root causes of hypothermia.\"We provide intensive, side-by-side training to mothers, caretakers, and healthcare workers,\" says Alejandra Villalobos, director of development at Embrace.\"We develop long-term partnerships with local governments and non-profits in every community where we work. \"We believe that increased access to both technology and education is necessary to achieve our ultimate vision: that every woman and child has an equal chance for a healthy life.\"", "continent": ""},

And with 60,000km (37,000 miles) successfully navigated, the team have achieved precisely that.The Turanor uses energy harnessed from more than 500 sq m of solar panels to drive two, 60kW electric engines, each in turn driving a standard propeller. They are capable of pushing the 35m catamaran to a top speed of 14 knots (26km/h, 16mph).On its journey, the boat averaged just five knots as the five-man crew charted a course around the equator to maximise exposure to the sun. They were at sea for 585 days as a result - somewhat longer than the record 45 days for sailing round the world.To boost power when the sun is weak or hiding, the boat holds eight tonnes of lithium ion batteries, capable of powering the vessel for three days when dark clouds shade the ocean skies.The most important numbers, however, are the smallest - the Turanor uses zero gallons of fuel and emits almost no carbon dioxide.\"Captaining the Turanor is a little bit special,\" says skipper Gerard d'Aboville.\"You have to use a lot of foresight, constantly checking the weather and choosing your speed to coincide with the sun. You must always think well in advance.\"It is different [from other boats], more interesting,\" he says.His latest voyage is a world first for a solar-powered boat, but Mr D'Aboville is already familiar with breaking records.In 1980, he rowed across the Atlantic. In 1991, he achieved a similar feat, this time across the Pacific, becoming the first man to row single-handed across both oceans.Now he has circumnavigated the world, albeit with a little help from nature.\"As I get older, my personal energy is less sustainable, so it's good to have a partner like the sun,\" he says.But Turanor's journey did not end with its circumnavigation of the world. Its emission-free propulsion gives the scientific community a rare opportunity to conduct important deep-water research.As Ms Bros de Puechredon says, once the potential of solar power had been demonstrated, \"the boat needed another purpose\".To this end, PlanetSolar teamed up with the University of Geneva to lead an expedition to study the Gulf Stream - which runs up the east coast of America and across the Atlantic to Ireland - and how changes within it are affecting global temperatures.\"To be able to spend several months studying the whole length of the stream in such a boat is unique,\" says Prof Martin Beniston, chair for climate change at the university.First, the boat enabled the team to \"collect vital samples from the atmosphere uncontaminated by exhaust fumes\", he says.This clean data, focusing both on the role of organisms living in vortexes within the stream and on the impact of aerosols released by it, suggest that oceans may play a much greater role in climate change than previously thought.The boat also helped \"communicate the science to the general public\", says Prof Beniston. \"The interest generated [by Turanor] has been amazing - we really weren't expecting so much public and media attention.\"The team has now signed a five-year contract with PlanetSolar and is planning to go back across the Atlantic to Rio to study the impact of Saharan dust on the ocean.Without rising global temperatures, Turanor would never have been conceived, let alone built.Shipping accounts for 2.7% of all global CO2 emissions, compared with less than 2% for aviation. According to the International Maritime Organization, emissions from ships could double by 2050.The industry itself points out that the vast majority of the world's trade is conducted across water, so emissions per unit of cargo from ships are a fraction of those from planes.That may be so, but ships themselves remain one of the dirtiest forms of transport, and some shipping companies are preparing for the inevitable legislation to curb emissions. Indeed the European Commission has already drafted proposals forcing all large ships using EU ports to measure and report their CO2 emissions.Cleaner technologies are inevitable, and a number of companies are developing what they hope will be the future of large vessel propulsion. One such firm is B9 Shipping, which has designed a 100m long cargo ship capable of carrying 4,000-5,000 tonnes of dry bulk, powered by sails and biogas engines fuelled by food waste.With fuel being the single biggest operational cost for any ship operator, the company says simple economics, as well as the inevitable cost of carbon permits, is driving interest in the ships.And while tried and trusted wind is leading the way, harnessing the sun's power remains an option for the future.\"Wind is the most sensible solution but there are areas where there is not much wind but a great deal of sun, and here solar can play a part,\" says B9's Diane Gilpin.Large tankers crossing oceans powered solely by the sun is an unlikely scenario, but there is no reason why ferries and pleasure boats, as well as those designed for scientific expeditions, cannot rely on solar power.As Reza Shaybani, chairman of the British Photovoltaic Association, says: \"We have to be realistic and a huge amount of research and development is needed, but the journey has to begin somewhere.\"By demonstrating that the sun alone can power a 100-tonne boat to circumnavigate the world, the MS Turanor PlanetSolar has proved just how far solar power has come.", "continent": ""},

But can funding passion projects of friends and family ruin relationships? 'Tis the season for feeling completely financially tapped out.But even after the gifts have been exchanged and the holiday dinners purchased, the pressure to give hasn't ended. In fact, thanks to technology, the pleas to spare some change for those in need now stretches on all year - with many of the requests coming from friends and family. Those who keep the company of creative types may already be feeling the pinch after  a year of Kickstarter and Indiegogo requests from friends seeking to fund their projects and ideas. Kickstarter, which allows fundraisers to solicit micro-donations to fund creative projects - also known as \"crowdfunding\" or \"crowdsourcing\" - has  from thousands of donors. Indiegogo hosted the fundraiser that raised over $700,00 (\u00a3432,980) for the  victimised by bullying. It's also become more common for individual web sites to solicit donations for all sorts of big requests - from supporting the  to fixing one's . \"If you need $10,000, targeting the masses is smart,\" says Farnoosh Torabi, a personal finance expert and host of Financially Fit on Yahoo. The social-media element of Kickstarter, in which fundraisers can solicit money through appeals on Facebook and Twitter, makes it easy to spread the message.\"It can generate a lot of enthusiasm and excitement,\" she says. While asking for money used to be the source of embarrassment, online giving \"has taken the fear out of it\", says Rhyan Romaine, a non-profit consultant and professional grant writer. \"It makes it easier for people to ask for money when they're protected by this online barrier.\" But for those on the other end of the ask, there's a risk of crowdfunding fatigue. Not to mention the pressure that comes with evaluating and donating to passion projects put forth by friends and loved ones. \"It can get tricky and you can end up overextending donations into thousands of things,\" says Romaine. In her personal life, she says, many of her friends are involved in charity projects, and sifting through them can be tricky. \"There's a bit of a quid pro quo. If I have a friend asking me to support a cause, I typically expect to be tantamount to what they gave my pet cause,\" she says - while noting that she's also vulnerable to requests that exert \"a real pull on my heartstrings\".But mixing finances and friendships have never been easy.\"Two words on the subject of money between friends:  'Be careful',\" says Philip Galanes, author of Social Q's: How to Survive the Quirks, Quandaries and Quagmires of Today. In that book and the Social Qs column for the New York Times, he says technological trappings don't eliminate underlying sources of conflict that have existed for centuries. The most important thing to remember, he says, is that no one is forcing you to give. \"Invitations to a pal's wedding or to help crowd-source his root canal are not invoices\" he says in an email to the BBC. \"We always have a choice - even if it requires climbing a Kilimanjaro of guilt to say no to a friend's request for cash.\" But how to choose? In evaluating which projects to give fund, perspective donors should keep a few things in mind, says Romaine. A successful project has \"clear goals and objectives,\" she says, as well as specific steps en route to that goal. In terms of showing support, it's often enough just to pitch in a little bit. \"The idea is you're going to crowdsource - they aren't looking for major contributions,\" says Torabi. A $5 or $10 gift will add up when others give as well. And that small donation has large has symbolic value. Just in the act of giving, you're showing support and encouragement, she says. There is always a chance that a crowdsourced donation . But there's also the chance that your hard-earned money could do more when donated to a friend's $500 dance project than an established ballet academy's $5m dollar endowment. \"If all you're giving for the whole year is $50, you might want to give to your friend because that's a real direct impact,\" says Torabi. No matter how much you give, the money you give should be though of as a gift - not an investment. \"We tend to get angry watching someone else fritter away our hard-earned dollars.  Or we can't help feeling that the recipient 'owes us' now - a sense of indebtedness that's often not returned,\" says Galanes. For those still on the fence about giving, it's ok to hold off. After all, another opportunity should present itself soon enough.", "continent": ""},

And, I'm telling you... this wine just tasted amazing.\"On a warm summer's day in August, Danish wine merchant Sune Rosforth took delivery of 8,000 bottles of wine that had arrived from France.From the offices of financial institutions flanking the quay, workers looked out at something that had not been seen in central Copenhagen for many years.The ship that had brought the wine from the Breton port of Brest was a 32m-long brigantine, a twin-masted sailing ship, called the Tres Hombres.Mr Rosforth's company, Rosforth and Rosforth, supplies restaurants in Denmark with organic and biodynamic wines.Moving wine in a more eco-friendly fashion was something he had been talking about for some time with an Anjou wine producer who was also a skipper, but the plan had originally been to use canal barges. \"One day he called us to tell us that there was an opportunity to get the wine finally shipped by a boat, but it was going to be a sailing vessel,\" he says. \"So we said, 'Fantastic, let's go!'\"In 2008 a company called Compagnie de Transport Maritime \u00e0 la Voile (CTMV) . Several shipments took place .But this hasn't stopped other companies trying their luck. The Tres Hombres set sail in 2009 from Amsterdam and has been shipping cargo ever since. It also gives land-lubbers the chance to sign on as part of the crew for a fee.The wine shipment was planned with their business partners, the sailing freight transport company TransOceanic Wind Transport (TOWT). The company works with a small fleet of sailing ships, and provides buyers with a means of tracking the journey the goods take.\"It's not some sort of adventurous poetic revival of 19th century technology, on the contrary it's something that is definitely addressing energy transition at sea,\" says TOWT founder Guillaume Le Grand.The maritime industry is estimated to produce 3%-5% of global carbon dioxide emissions - making sailing very attractive to the organic and eco-friendly sector.But as the price of oil rises, so does the cost of traditional cargo options.This has led to research into alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), and a slowdown in the speed at which cargo freighters move at - .For Mr Le Grand this all adds up to opportunity.\"Until 10-12 years ago, most of the ships were crossing oceans at about 20 knots average speed. Now they're going down below 15 knots,\" he says.\"[The Tres Hombres] crosses the ocean at 8 to 10 knots. It's not something that's ridiculous in terms of speed.\"There are other challenges. Arrival times are unpredictable, capacity is limited, and at the moment sail shipping is relatively expensive.\"We are using solutions of the 19th century to speak to people of the 21st century,\" says Mr Le Grand.\"Tres Hombres is a statement. They know very well it's a 32-metre brigantine, which is small, but they are paving the way for shipping cargo by sailing ships.\"The only way to become competitive, he says, will be to build a large fleet of large cargo ships.The team behind the Tres Hombres are looking at doing just that, with plans for a .They are not the only ones.B9 Shipping's Diane Gilpin has been working on plans for a sail-powered cargo ship since 1994.She was inspired by The Atlantic Clipper, a sail-assisted cargo ship that sailed between the UK and the Caribbean in the 1980s.\"What I think we need to be looking at is the significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study showed that if [the global shipping fleet] was a country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter in the world,\" she says.The world needs to develop a technology that is capable of moving commodities in significant quantities in order to address this challenge, she says.The answer that B9 is proposing is a coastal cargo ship that combines massive carbon-fibre DynaRig sails - such as  - with an engine that runs on bio-gas made from food waste using a process called .The liquid bio-methane produced by this process can be used in an existing LNG engine. \"Effectively, we are combining technology that already exists in a way that will enable us to build a 100%-renewably-powered cargo vessel immediately,\" she says.The company hopes the vessel will sail 60% of the time.Using bio-gas means they can more accurately predict operational costs, says Diane Gilpin. This has also meant working closely with the British Met Office on sophisticated weather routing products. A scale model of the vessel was tested over the summer at Southampton University. The results are being used to predict performance and to optimise routes.Richard Pemberton, a research engineer at the university who took part in the testing, says he feels the project has potential.\"[With] the right cargo on the right route, then sail power becomes viable, particularly if fuel costs just get higher and higher,\" he says.Mr Pemberton doesn't see hybrid sailing ships taking over quite yet however.\"Some of the cargo will still be shipped with normal fossil fuels,\" he says. As well as numerous , commercial attempts to harness wind power are on the increase.A  is already marketing a system that uses a giant kite to help tow commercial shipping, cutting fuel consumption.In Japan the  is also looking at fitting sails to cargo ships.Nick Brown, of shipping experts Lloyd's Register, says the society is seeing a lot of interest in wind technology.\"I think it comes down to a commercial decision, on a combination of investment cost and the implications for probably longer sailing times,\" he says.According to Mr Brown, when it comes to \"cleaner\" forms of propulsion, choice is limited.\"If there are no ships, there is no world trade. Half the world freezes, the other half starves. \"The big risk is the view on carbon emissions, because LNG is hugely beneficial - much, much cleaner than alternative fossil fuel options available at the moment - but [it is still] a fossil fuel,\" he says.\"And obviously nuclear power has been used successfully in applications by navies for more than 40 years, but there's a big political and societal block to it being adopted more widely. So, the focus is much more on renewables. And wind is potentially really exciting.\" For now, using sail technology in commercial shipping remains something of a niche. But rising oil prices, and the resulting slower speeds at which international freight moves, could all push its economic viability.\"The shipping industry isn't an emotional industry whatsoever, it is purely commercial,\" says Southampton University's Richard Pemberton.\"If someone could make money out of [sail technology] and get a good return, then they'll back it. It is that simple. And the big shipping companies are very interested in it, so they must see some potential in it making money.\"", "continent": ""},

It's a system called micropayments, and some believe it is the future for supporting journalism, and other creative content, on the internet. The likes of Google and Paypal have begun to roll out and promote their technologies, and there are a number of smaller players hoping to break-through.Of course, in the BBC's case, articles are effectively pre-paid by a combination of the licence fee and income from international advertising deals.But for most news organisations - newspapers especially - online content supported by advertising just isn't paying the bills.Revenues are down, newsrooms are shrinking, and publishers are, without exaggerating, panicking.So far, the majority of sites that have decided to charge readers online have opted for some kind of variant on what is widely known as a paywall.They're not particularly popular - and are often seen as creating virtual ghost towns, pushing thousands of readers away.As the name suggests, paywalls keep all the valuable content under lock and key. Access can be gained via a subscription, much in the way a print subscriber can arrange to get a newspaper delivered every day to their home.Both London's Financial Times and New York's Wall Street Journal are successfully playing the paywall game - but they do so with a wealth of exclusive content in areas other less business-minded newspapers rarely tread.More general publications have faced a bigger challenge. The Times of London put up its paywall in 2010, and traffic was reported to have dropped by more than 80%.That said, it has performed better than most had perhaps anticipated, attracting more than 100,000 subscribers in a year.The New York Times has made notable strides in experimenting with content models. Up to 10 articles a month can be read for free - but beyond that, a fee is applied.The journalism in both titles still largely relies on the efforts of journalists whose employment is thanks to the success of the printed product - sales of which, like most other newspapers, are in decline.Perhaps most disastrously, Johnston Press, one of the UK's largest newspaper groups, attempted to put some of its local newspapers behind pay walls in 2009 - only for the experiment to wither and die a few months later. Their paying subscribers, it was reported, numbered in the tens.So far, so disheartening. But why? It may seem obvious, but Jakob Nielsen, one of the world's leading experts on usability, believes it is not just about money.\"Having a registration screen, even for free, turns the vast majority of people off,\" he says.\"It's not just a matter of monetary cost, it's also a matter of the 'interaction cost'. You have to add those two together. What is the extra hassle for the user?\"The interaction cost of setting up a new account; not just time, but also the thinking - the pondering over 'should I really do this?' or 'is it safe to use this system I've never heard of?' and so forth. \"That's all a huge amount of overhead for the user.\"But Charlie Beckett, founding director of journalism and society think tank POLIS, believes the challenges faced by newspapers go deeper than just poor user experience.\"I think there are brilliant payment models for anything,\" he says, \"Except journalism. \"There's a myth that people ever liked news.\"News is entertaining - but it's not as entertaining as a pop video, or a download of music. In that sense it's a tougher sell.\"But could micropayments offer readers an attractive middle ground? A deal with a reader which dodges the commitment and cost of a subscription, but doesn't give away the content for free?In a , Mr Nielsen boldly predicted that \"most sites that are not financed through traditional product sales will move to micropayments in less than two years\".Of course - that hasn't happened.\"I think we're still waiting for a really centralised initiative,\" he says, with a sense of frustration.\"It's very much a chicken and egg problem.\"Chicken and egg, he says, because in order for a single micropayment system to take off, it has to be seen as the popular choice among readers. But for that to happen, it needs to be adopted by a large range of outlets.He believes the solution to this could be in our pockets.\"The next best hope going forward is that it's something that evolves out of the mobile devices. \"The first step is already in place - there are these app stores and music stories and ringtones and so forth. Typically the phone comes with some kind of ability to pay. \"Also there's a lot of talk to expand mobile phones into a mobile wallet you can use to pay in the super market, and so forth.\"Making a push in this area is Google with its Wallet system.Through its Android mobile devices - particularly those with near-field communication (NFC) technologies - the company hopes that in future millions will pay for things with their mobiles rather than traditional credit cards.Included in its plan for Wallet is what the search giant calls \"an experiment to see if users will be prepared to pay for individual web pages if the buying process is sufficiently easy\".On a page introducing the technology to businesses, it gives several examples of websites in which the first part of some written content is viewable, but the remainder is greyed out.With a click, the grey is removed - and a small fee is charged to the user's Google account. If readers don't like what they have bought, they can get an instant refund.It is a seamless, one-click transaction - a world away from a lengthy sign-up process.It cannot be any other way, argues Mr Nielsen, who says buying with micropayments must be as simple as working a household switch.\"You turn on the light when it gets dark - and immediately it starts charging you. \"But you don't have to log-in to turn on the light.\"Google is taking baby steps with this idea thus far, and its competitors are significant. Paypal launched its micropayment system in 2010, with an added chutzpah that comes with being long established as a popular way to pay for things across millions of sites on the web.Popular video site Vimeo, famed for its HD movies, indie films and documentaries, offers micropayments - but its scheme relies on goodwill, asking for a small amount after content has been enjoyed, like a virtual tip jar.Micropayments offer something of an improvement, Mr Beckett agrees, but he says it is far from a solution.\"The internet just makes it incredibly hard to have what we used to have before: this lovely cupboard where we could keep the news in, and if you were very good and gave us some money we would let you have some.\"Once you've lost that, it's very difficult to get it back.\"  ", "continent": ""},

Tunics, shoes and jewellery - are all being snapped.Photos are uploaded within minutes; to be seen by millions of online customers across the country.This is the new world of e-commerce in India.Jabong is one of the latest companies to enter the market. Selling more than 50,000 products from shoes to cutlery online, the company says the Indian market is promising - especially in small towns, where more than half of all online sales comes from.Arun Chandramohan is one of company's founders and chief executive.He says India is \"structurally more attractive because we have a large youth population, growing aspiration, a large country where we don't have very high penetration of malls\".Increasingly Indian shoppers have discovered buying items with just a click of a button, including through their mobile phones too. Travel booking websites are the most popular choice. The Indian railways ticket site is used by almost one in five of the country's web users, according to research company Comscore.But retail websites are fast catching up as more young people begin to buy their clothes and shoes online.While there are only about 10 million active online shoppers right now, the industry estimates that there are over a hundred million consumers ready to spend their money over the web.But getting to those consumers is not easy - India faces serious issues with poor infrastructure and logistics. Most companies, like Jabong, follow a model where they buy products, pile them high in their warehouses and hope consumers will buy it from them.But this approach adds the costs of warehousing, inventory and logistics.Some others follow the marketplace model. This is when a company displays products from various vendors on their website and orders a product only after a consumer buys it online.But it means shipping and delivery may take longer.The sustainability of both business models is a critical issue, warns K Vaitheeswaran, the boss of Indiaplaza - the country's first e-commerce site.\"So far all the investors who have come and heavily invested in new e-commerce companies have asked for sales and top-line growth,\" he says. \"But they ignored profits. Suddenly they are beginning to realise that they may not get good returns on their money.\" He says his company has survived this long because they have kept operating costs low.When the company was first set up in 1999, less than three million people used the internet in India, and only about 20,000 people actually shopped online.Now, the country is among the top three fastest growing internet markets in the world - last year, internet use surged by 41%.The potential to grow further is huge.According to Rajan Anandan, managing director of Google India, of the 137 million internet users in India, only about 25 million are involved in online transactions. In comparison, China has already got more than 180 million people transacting online.While the number of people getting online is increasing, getting them to spend their money is still difficult. Companies say the cost of acquisition of customers is quite high.To attract new customers, firms have to spend money on advertising and offer discount coupons or have flash sales.Some industry estimates suggest that firms are spending between $15-$50 (\u00a39.30-\u00a331.20) in getting each customer. So the country's $10bn market is driven mainly by companies offering big discounts and free deliveries.The other big problem facing companies is that very few Indians own credit cards. So most firms have an option where customers can pay cash on delivery - adding significantly to their costs.But while the costs are daunting, it hasn't stopped companies from entering the market.Amazon's Indian venture, Junglee.com, doesn't sell products directly but aggregates information from different e-commerce sites. Ebay India, which started in 2005, clocks six transactions per minute, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India. In comparison, India's largest e-commerce company, Flipkart sells 20 items per minute.E-commerce accounted for the maximum chunk of private equity and venture capital deals in 2011 according to a study by advisory firm, Zinnov. They reported that the sector has grown 800% since 2008. Another firm, Technopak, predicts the ecommerce market to hit $70 billion by 2020.But the worry is that none of the companies are making a profit yet.And there are signs of a funds crunch. Venture capitalists are becoming more wary as barely any e-commerce firms so far have made any profit.Already some consolidation is taking place.Sunjay Guleria is co-founder of Sher Singh and Exclusively, sites which target Indian expats. He recently sold his company to another retailer, Myntra.He agrees that capital has tightened up considerably.\"There will be winners and there will be losers. \"India itself - the landscape is very small in terms of the conversion rates. So there will be people who just don't make it.\"It'll be the bigger guys who have achieved scale that are doing millions of dollars a month in transactions that will break away from the path.\"With organised retail accounting for less than 5% of the market, ecommerce is leap-frogging across the country especially in towns that lack supermarkets or shopping malls. As incomes improve, and more young people get online to buy, the brands they aspire to own is increasingly just a click away. Promising news for the companies that have dived in - but making big profits may take longer than they originally hoped.", "continent": ""},

It involves all processes from getting material or produce out of the ground, processing it into product, distributing it to customers and finally returning the product to the ground in a sustainable way.  Technology impacts each element of the supply chain from distribution to getting the product back into the ground.Our new year bottle of champagne, for example, will involve:The glass supply chain is required for the bottles. Corks, labels and the metal to hold the cork also needs to be sourced and produced.  We then need to move our bottle of champagne from vineyard to supermarket, to your home and finally once drunk the bottle may be recycled and the process continues again.An increasing group of consumers, labelled the \"compassionate consumer\", want to change how supply chains are structured.  The compassionate consumer considers the full effects of buying something, including the values and practices of the company from which items are purchased, the social impact of items being bought, and who benefits when items are obtained from a particular business.  They ask questions about the impact of their purchasing decision on the planet, the people working in the extended supply chain and ultimately who profits.  As global communication technology evolves, consumers have clearer insights into an organisation's supply chain.  Apple, for example, publishes an annual supplier responsibility report, freely available to download. Their own audits in recent years have revealed cases of child labour, and also poisoning of workers due to inappropriate practices within Apple suppliers.  How does the compassionate consumer view such indiscretions?The severe pressure on resources where many raw materials are in short supply is also driving change.  Oil is starting to run short, so prices will keep rising. Money is tight, so organisations can't afford new machinery or large inventories.  Lack of space and skilled manpower can also be a major constraint. Even water is a scarce and under-appreciated resource.   Technology helps us to innovate and adapt to this new world, but also centuries-old approaches come back into fashion.One solution is to rethink the way we use resources. Instead of the \"consumption\" model - buy something, use it, throw it away, do we need a more sustainable model where resources are borrowed, shared or rented?Questioning ownership provides challenges for us all.  Does every household need its own lawnmower? Does every company need its own warehouse, factory and vehicle fleet? Or could asset-sharing and collaborative working increase efficiency and reduce wastage and transport utilisation?This is driving the technology of the supply chain. The critical focus is collaboration and transparency. Supply chain transparency technology enables all those within the supply chain network to see and know where resources are, if a \"supply chain event\" occurs. This could be triggered by commercial needs such as a buy-one-get-one-free promotion - or even by a natural disaster. All members of the supply chain network are alerted. This critically allows the supply chain network, like a complex ecosystem, to plan collaboratively and respond to changes quickly. Mobile technology with location services lets people know where people or objects are.  This technology also means you can know the actual location of a vehicle in real time, so for a home delivery a customer can track the order being delivered, or receive an automatic alert when the vehicle with their package is within a certain radius.On a larger scale, container ships and even individual containers can now be tracked, letting companies plan their supply chain more effectively.Our personal decisions can impact planet, people and profit.  Research has shown that for non-food items, a consumer who becomes the last part of the supply chain by taking a product home after buying it in a store typically creates 4,274g of carbon dioxide.  However a van that delivers the item to your house as part of its round only generates 181 grams of carbon dioxide per item delivered.  The reality is even if you are not at home, the van could re-deliver 20 times before the same level of carbon dioxide is created.So for the planet it would seem to be best to buy online. But is it best for the people in our local community working in shops? And who ultimately in this new world really profits?", "continent": ""},

Smartly dressed in a shirt and tie, he has just come from a meeting with an investor who has agreed to fund his agricultural services start-up. He smiles widely, his happiness infectious as he talks about how his business got started.\"I started Brave East Africa without a coin on me. That was June 2010 when I finished my final year at Makere University, I was doing bachelor of animal production at the college of veterinary medicine,\" he says.Inspired by his single parent mother, Mr Ssemakula set about creating what he hopes will become a multinational agribusiness that helps east African farmers build profitable and sustainable businesses.\"My mother has been father and mother, supporting the family slowly through her work. I wanted to follow the same path.\" The first step was to find somewhere to work from. But with no money options were limited - so he came up with the idea of trading veterinary officer services for a seat in an internet cafe, run by a group of farmers. Writing for a newspaper about agriculture, in return for having the name of his business and contact details prominently displayed, attracted customers, bringing precious funds to invest in the business. Finally he was ready to move to an office environment which would allow him to meet clients and investors and to be taken seriously.Setting up on your own in east Africa isn't cheap. Not only is there rent to consider, there's furniture, utilities and the internet connection that remains prohibitively expensive for ordinary Ugandans.So instead Mr Ssemakula decided to become a member of the Mara Launchpad, one of a new breed of home-grown co-working spaces and innovation hubs in Kampala.\"If you're working from home or out of your car here in Uganda people don't take you seriously,\" says Mara Launchpad's Nigel Ball. \"They're worried because trust levels are lower, and if you don't have an office how do they track you down if things go wrong.\"Providing office space is a simple thing to do, says Mr Ball. But what the Launchpad wants to do is give technology and non-technology companies credibility in the eyes of potential clients or partners.\"Getting the right kind of office that projects the right kind of image, that's in the right location, at the right price, is not an easy task,\" he says. There's a large open plan room filled with desks, with wifi connectivity, as well as various meeting rooms. In the room next door regular Friday night innovation events are held, organised by the Mara Foundation and the Angels Finance Corporation, the people behind the Launchpad.Business incubation and mentorship is available, as well as a six week acceleration program that runs twice a year.Over the last couple of years, tech hubs and other co-working spaces have started popping up in towns and cities worldwide. For emerging economies, the services and advice they offer can have even more impact than in the developed world. Taking the lead from the granddaddy of them all, Nairobi's iHub, they are spreading rapidly across the African continent.In an office block on a residential street in Kampala, Barbara Birungi sits at her desk with a cup of tea. She is the manager of the Hive CoLab, less a co-working space than a start-up incubator. Technology entrepreneurs who fit their criteria can spend two years based in the open plan offices.\"It's not about strict business. It's also about coming here to share your ideas, and collaborate. Because out of sharing and collaborating come ideas,\" says Ms Birungi. \"Apart from just offering them a space we see how we can take an idea to the next level. Because many startups fail within the first two years of existence.\"As well as regular events and Mobile Monday innovation sessions, the incubator offers mentoring and support finding investors, helping them to protect their intellectual property.\"We have seen examples where investors actually take up someone's idea, and because there's no paperwork, there's no proof they have done that,\" she says.Kampala's newest space is Outbox, a co-working space and technology start-up incubator and accelerator that counts Google among its partners.Richard Zulu is a co-founder. He says working with developers and realising they needed help to get them to the next level pushed him to open the hub.\"It's very important that the people that start these places share the same passions as the people that work in them,\" says Mr Zulu.\"A place like this creates a focal point, where you'll be able to meet A, B, C, D people in the tech community. Through the co-working initiative it drives entrepreneurship and innovation through the participants of the space.\"The core is community.\"The space specialises in mobile and web start-ups, and Outbox is already home to at least one award-winning business.Senegalese-born social entrepreneur and blogger Marieme Jamme mentors founders and managers of some of Africa's technology hubs. She believes that while the hype surrounding the new hubs is increasing the visibility of African developers, the type of mentorship available in the Ugandan hubs is vital to their success. And it's not available at all of the spaces opening up across the continent.\"You have ideas generated within those tech hubs, but they don't know how to scale those businesses. They have the business acumen and the passion, but they don't know how to go through setting up that business, or writing that business plan.\"You'll find out that 90% of them don't know how to do it. But when an investor comes in they hide their discomfort, and pretend they know how to do it. This is African pride, this is inside the African mindset. \"It's not because they're not good people, it's the way the mindset works.\"Another problem according to Ms Jamme is the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge when it comes to coding and development.\"That's why it's very important for us to go back and say, it's ok if you don't know, and work out how you help these entrepreneurs scale their businesses.\"How can you move the coder from a coder to a CEO?\"Mr Ssemakula is certain coming to the Mara Launchpad was the right thing to do. As well giving farmers agricultural and financial advice, the company is working on technology to link the farmers to high-value markets using text messages.\"The Mara Launchpad has changed my business by providing me with a professional business environment that commands more credibility in the eyes of my customers, in this case the farmers, who find me in such a setting and they see my business as a serious business.\" His dreams of sitting at the helm of a multi-national agribusiness are becoming more tangible, with plans for his first branch office in Nairobi, Kenya.\"[The Launchpad] has given me access to free business mentorship and how to go about being an entrepreneur in a practical way.\" \"I'm glad to be here.\"  ", "continent": ""},

A typical mid-range laptop computer today has 250,000 times the memory, is 4-8 million times faster and costs 1/500th of what the Ferranti cost as a computing platform.This process, the acceleration of technological capability, is known as Moore's law - and it has meant that since the late 1800s, the rates of technology adoption and diffusion into society have kept getting faster.While the telephone took approximately 50 years to reach critical mass, television took just half that (about 23-25 years). Mobile phones and PCs took about 12-14 years (half again), and then the internet took just seven years (half again).New technologies and initiatives such as the iPod and Facebook are now being adopted by consumers en masse in timescales that are now measured in months, not years. Apple sold more mobile devices in 2011 alone than all the Mac computers it had ever sold in the 28 years prior. This was the same year that saw the internet surpass television and newspapers as the primary news source for much of the developed world.Also in this year, the average time spent daily using mobile phone apps surpassed the time people spent surfing the web on their PC.All of this technological change has given rise to a new kind of customer. The kind of customers for whom the stuff that bankers consider \"new\" is in fact just life. It's normal.Many businesses are now muscling in on territory traditionally held by the banks. Many mobile carriers are providing pre-paid mobile wallets systems - as are stores like Starbucks.Already 30% of Americans are using pre-paid cards - products that don't need the issuer to have a banking licence. It means that a new audience of digitally connected people are beginning to decouple in their minds, their day-to-day relationship with their High Street bank.The oldest surviving bank in the world today is the Monte dei Paschi di Siena, founded in 1472. Its original branch still stands in Siena. If you were to visit that branch back when it opened the experience would have been very familiar to that of most modern retail banking customers.A cashier sits behind a small window, a desk to sit and talk to the \"banker\", a big safe where all the deposits are stored.This kind of customer experience is a total anathema to the customers of tomorrow. In Britain, only 30% of people regularly use a branch, and half of this group are small businesses that are still reliant on cash. With new mobile payments services such as Square (in the US) and the Swedish firm iZettle coming thick and fast, how long will this status quo last?Even if current trends don't accelerate at all, by 2016 by far the most common interaction that most people will have with their bank will be through their smartphone.Banking through our desktop computers, or telephones, will still play a major role. But, in the era of big data and exponential technological progress, can there really still be a role for the 1472 model of banking? Banks insist that face-to-face advice is still the reason people visit branches. But the truth is that, with current account margins so razor thin, there is little or no incentive for banks to spend money giving people advice that keeps them out of debt.Already major payments providers like Visa are pushing Near Field Communications (NFC) payment solutions hard - a raft of contactless payment systems is beginning to hit the market.The tipping point for these types of payments is fast approaching. I believe this new kind of technology will pave the way for a new kind of financial advice. Instead of visiting a branch once every year, spending advice can be pushed through to the payment device itself.Rather than a \"once-a-year financial health check-up\", it's far more powerful to tell a customer, as they're about to buy something, what percentage of their monthly income is represented by what they are about to spend their money on.More importantly, this is the kind of advice that the customers can choose for themselves. The banks that prosper will be those that have become very, very good at being virtual and digital repositories of their clients' money, allowing access to that money anywhere at any time. Most of all, however, the successful banks will be those that become great service organisations. Despite all of the dazzling technological possibilities, there is no silver bullet, no single new technology that will change the face of banking. That will be driven by people. The banks that succeed in the future will be those that are willing to listen and respond to their customers in a way that no major bank is doing at the moment. In my opinion, that's no bad thing.", "continent": ""},

In the UK, that figure is 80%, with 24% using it daily.These countries may be at the top of the list - but the figures point to a growing trend. Rather than resign themselves to audiences watching with half an eye, while posting pictures of kittens on Facebook, broadcasters are looking for ways to harness this trend to keep viewers engaged. No verifiable eyeballs on your content leads to dwindling advertising income.At IBC, the annual gathering of the broadcast industry in Amsterdam, the rise of the second screen, or companion device (that's a tablet or smartphone to you and me) was the topic of the moment. If the idea of a coming zombie apocalypse keeps you up at night, you may have found yourself watching The Walking Dead for tips. So many of us tuned in that its broadcaster, FX UK, decided to create a companion app for series two that would appeal to viewers, but that would keep those precious eyeballs glued to the screen during the important bits.\"It was fascinating to tie [the app] with the idea of gamification with that particular programme, with that fanbase, which seemed to make sense,\" says Steve Plunkett, chief technology officer at broadcast technology and service provider Red Bee.\"But we had no idea how it was going to play out with the public. So we were delighted to see the take-up rates which were great.\"As well as being popular with audiences, it has also won an IBC innovation award. A bit like Cluedo for the undead, the app lets you predict how many zombies will bite the dust during each episode, who will despatch them, and the most common weapon of choice. As each member of the undead hordes meets their maker, the app notes the kill, who was responsible and how they did it. At the end of the episode viewers discover how close they got, and can then share the results on Facebook and Twitter.\"What's interesting is that we can now accurately tie together the two screens,\" says Mr Plunkett.  \"We knew exactly what episode you were watching, you just switched on and it figured everything out, and knew exactly where you were in the programme.\"It uses technology known as audio watermarking, which lets the app work whether you watch live, time-shifted or recorded on your DVR.Tiny chunks of data that are inaudible to humans are embedded in the soundtrack of the show. The device running the app then \"listens\" as the episode starts, works out which one you are watching and synchronises with it.For content where it's not possible or practical to embed data, audio fingerprinting can be used, where specific audio triggers the synchronisation of an app. For devices that don't have microphones, signals sent via the internet can also be used.Another show with a cult following that has its own companion app is US biker gang saga Sons of Anarchy.The app has evolved over two seasons, according to Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan.\"[In our proof of concept app] you see a character you like, you want his hat, you want his jacket. They had all the items already on the website, but by presenting it on this app they really saw a huge uptake of sales.\"This year we have a full application that has trivia that gets people really engaged in the show, exclusive on-set photos and some of the writers on the show have contributed to the content in the application.\"The app also synchronises with each episode, letting viewers track the conversation about episodes on social media - regardless of when they're watching.\"We built something called the social timeline so you can actually follow the show through tweets that are happening as things happen specifically in the show. \"This really works well in times-shifted environments - different time zones, catch-up TV situations where you still want to follow along the conversation.\"The next step for Magic Ruby is looking at new ways of making money from these apps.\"It would probably be difficult to do the traditional or banner advertising in this space,\" he says. \"So it's how do we get advertisers to do interactive advertising, get involved in the show, it's not just your watching the show and this car commercial that has zero context comes up.\"John Stoneman of mobile advertising specialists InMobi agrees.\"For it to be effective, it needs to be complementary to the user's experience and not obtrusive... and that's one of the great things about the second screen. The consumer has the option to engage if they want to, but it's not forcing them to sit through something they don't want.\"Mr Stoneman believes broadcasters need to come to terms with second screen devices, and how they're being used.The chief executive of online video platform Brightcove, Jeremy Allaire, believes there's a more radical shift taking place. The company recently launched their app creation platform AppCloud, aimed at letting broadcasters and other content creators build companion apps.\"In my mind I think that the current effort is sort of a band-aid or a hack, and the real opportunity is when the full content experience and the applications that interact with that content are all delivered over the internet to tablets or smart TVs.\" he says.The company is also creating full screen TV apps aimed at content far beyond regular programming. \"Dual screen TV apps are about really using the TV set as the second screen. \"The tablet becomes the primary screen you interact with, you make choices on, and discover on and the large display is where you have rich media and consume content and information.\"Perhaps unsurprisingly he has strong views on the future of television.\"Linear television is not going to be saved by companion second-screen applications, that's for sure. I think you know more likely 90% of the content that's on linear television should really just be content that's published on demand.\"Not everyone agrees. Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan sees things differently.\"I think people still love TV, they love the content, and now they can have the interactivity and the interactivity with their friends. \"You're by yourself on the couch and you're watching with multiple people. It's perfect for live events, for sports, for reality shows, water-cooler-type TV shows.\"No knows what lies ahead - but maybe there's room for something in between.One of the most popular demonstrations at IBC is broadcast software experts NDS' video wall.In their conception of the future the walls of our home become a giant television screen, that integrates with the wallpaper. Content selection is done from a tablet device, and is \"thrown\" to the wall you want to view it on.This can be anything from movies, television, radio, social media and news to the family calendar, the view from your nannycam, or family photos and videos.It can be any size you want, with as much or as little content on display. Audio is directional, and advertising and other broadcast furniture can be arranged around the picture, leaving the image clean.At the moment screen technology means the bevels are clearly visible between panels. But it doesn't take much imagination to picture technology like Sony's new 4k ultra-high definition television, also on show at the exhibition, or NHK's 8k super hi vision, or even Dolby's glasses-free 3D making the experience even more immersive.Whatever the future holds, one thing is clear. As a species we are likely to become ever more addicted to vast amounts of content - wherever it comes from. As long as the zombies don't get us first...", "continent": ""},

The Canadian company specialises in supplying eco-friendly toys to shops across the country.Father Christmas has his sleigh and an army of elves to help make sure that all the toys get to the right place for Christmas day.But how does a small company, which started in founder Linda Stortz's basement and a decade later now has 10 employees, track stock and make sure inventory gets to where it needs to be in a timely fashion?The answer is enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. It's something all the big players use - and using industry-leading products like SAP's NetSuite has a correspondingly-big price tag. \"I thoroughly investigated the solutions that are out there,\" says Mr Diament. Many of the products didn't translate well to a small business distribution environment, he says. Almost all were too expensive. Finally, after considering and discarding a procession of products, he settled on start-up BizSlate.\"BizSlate is developed to really control your inventory, sometimes we have customers that want certain size boxes and labels, that's already included.\"Some customers, they want to get eight in a box, they don't want six. BizSlate does it really well to pull inventory, recognize what's left in open stock, do your packs, tell you how many boxes you need.\"The software-as-a-service (SaaS) system is web-based, with data held in the cloud, and no need to install expensive servers.It is customisable, with optional industry-specific functionality, and lets small businesses manage everything including customers, vendors, orders, inventory, order processing and overall supply chain. It also integrates with Quickbooks (small business accounting software).Mr Diament believes that as well as cost - he estimates it comes in at about 30% of the average quote he was given elsewhere - his ability to give feedback sets it apart.\"[Founder Marc Kalman] really knows the distribution business,\" he says.\"It's not going to save you, it's not going to create anything for you, it's not going to make your business. \"However if you have something going on now it is an accelerator. It's going to help you do things quicker. It's going to enable you to have a faster workflow.\"Marc Kalman has worked in distribution and supply chain technology most of his working life.\"One of the things I found is that it was surprising to me that there aren't more solution providers that cater to this market,\" he says.\"When we started initially, before we wrote a single line of code, we made very few assumptions on our own.\"He has instituted a 19 customer steering committee that works to improve the product.\"I've sat down with everyone one and one, we tour the warehouse, we look at how their internal staff operates.\"I ask them, I don't want to know what you like or dislike about your current system, just talk to me about what you need. Because it's clear to me there are companies out there but no one's done a good job of solving the problems small companies face in a small business market.\"Half-a-world away in east Africa, companies trying to get their products onto customer shelves face different challenges, often caused by a massive lag in technology infrastructure.When your customers don't have computers and can't access the internet, how do you automate? Ugandan start-up Afrocyber has developed an award-wining platform called EasyOrder that lets your customers order stock using their mobile phones. Relatively-few people own smartphones in the region, so text messages can be used instead of an app or website.Founder Billy Kaye says manufacturers in the region face what he calls \"blind supply problems\".\"Basically what they do is they load up a truck with goods, and they move these trucks hopping from customer to customer, asking them how much produce do you want, how many beers do you want, and then they give them the crates,\" he says.Their largest customer to date is Tanzania's biggest drinks manufacturer Azam. Since using EasyOrder, the company has stopped sending out trucks speculatively. Instead orders are received via text. Vans are loaded up with goods for customers who are close together, and when a van is full it sets off to make the deliveries. Locations are pinpointed on a map using GPS technology, and the drivers all have tablets to let them find their destinations. Customers can call and find out where their delivery is and when it will arrive, and can pay using mobile money transfer.It's been a huge success, says Mr Kaye, but not without a few hiccups.\"The first day it crashed their whole system. They couldn't handle the orders, because it overwhelmed their production line.\"Finding out what their customers actually wanted to buy, rather than effectively dictating demand based on the contents of a lorry, meant the company had to overhaul production lines.They have been able to cut the size of their transport fleet, reduce their fuel bill, and sell more juice.Afrocyber is now working on rolling out EasyOrder throughout east Africa, and increasing the number of paying customers.Most companies would see solving their distribution worries as a very welcome gift.

That little imaginary companion, sitting on your shoulder. \"Go on,\" it says. \"You deserve a treat. Buy it.\"That \"it\" could be anything. Clothes, shoes, gadgets - we all have our vices.But what if that imaginary voice - which is, willpower permitting, under your control - one day became real?DBS Bank calls it a \"personal concierge\", and it's best understood by picturing yourself in an expensive designer clothes shop. Your smartphone knows where you are - thanks to the GPS location technology found in many apps these days - and it alerts your bank through an automated system that you've signed up to. As well as knowing you've got a history of buying from similar stores, your bank also knows that you're running a bit low on cash at the moment.It realises the chances of you buying may be pretty low. That \"voice\" on your shoulder is pretty quiet as realism sets in.Ordinarily, unless you wanted to go hungry that month, you'd leave the store.But wait! Your phone beeps. A text message. Buy it in the next 20 minutes, it could say, and you can borrow the money at a good rate. Not only that, but you'll get 20% off the clothes.You leave the shop, bags in hand. You've been a successful participant in a process known as \"right place, right time\" marketing.Of course, even banks like DBS, one of Asia's biggest, can't afford to pay an individual to keep tabs on all of its banking customers, and so it adopts technology which is growing rapidly in many industries: intelligent algorithms.\"Algorithms are effectively the new slave,\" explains John Bates, chief technology officer for Progress, a company which specialises in creating algorithm platforms for a wide range of businesses.He says that in an ideal world, banks - or any loyalty-dependent business - would be able to offer each and every customer a personal assistant keeping an eye on them so they could target the ultimate offers to suit the individual. But logistically, of course, that's out of the question.\"They can't afford that - not even by outsourcing to India or China or wherever the cheapest place these days. \"So you're going to use technology. Algorithms don't need to go to the bathroom, algorithms don't need a pay cheque.\"Progress works with a number of businesses who use algorithms to make key business decisions.Not all of them are prepared to go public - the trade can sometimes seem like a shady business, guilty of pigeonholing consumers into pre-determined groupings. Others argue that such systems could even be racially profiling people.But the techniques are gathering momentum, lead by evidence of rapidly growing profits and effectiveness.Turkcell, Turkey's largest mobile telecoms provider, recently won an award for its implementation of algorithms. Similar to the efforts of DBS Bank, Turkcell - also a Progress client - was targeting offers based on a user's location.\"We have seen that those offers sent using the real-time marketing system result in up to ten times more positive responses than those offers sent using conventional methods,\" says Turkcell's chief consumer business officer Emre Sayin.Elsewhere in the business world, algorithms are being used to tempt people to splash out on a lot more than just luxury goods.Venture capitalists like David Coats, are using it to make crucial business decisions.His company, Correlation Ventures, invests in technology start-ups based on various criteria that is crunched by its own algorithm. If a start-up passes the test, it earns investment.\"What we started to notice was how time-consuming and distracting the fundraising process often is for entrepreneurs,\" Mr Coats told the BBC.\"All that time taking away from time they could be spending managing their business.\"Start-ups looking for investment will submit around five documents detailing financials and other business information.This data is fed into a program which compares it against a database of over 20 years of venture capital activity.Those who pass the algorithm test will be given a 30-minute interview, go through some background checks and then... get investment. It all takes about a fortnight.\"We do not repeat classic due diligence,\" Mr Coats continued.\"We commit to how much money we're going to invest in the company over the company's life, and we do not take board seats.\"While this approach may appear a little gung-ho to hardened business people more used to trusting their gut instinct rather than a computer, Mr Coats said the system is designed to complement existing systems.\"That gut feeling, and the lead-VC diligence is vital,\" Mr Coats insists.\"This is not replacing that, it's an overlay.\"Crucially, Correlation Ventures is never the first investor in a company. Before firms get to Mr Coats and his team, they will have been backed by other investors who have spent lengthy time checking out their credentials.Their scheme, Mr Coats said, is simply about shortening the time it takes to get more money on board.Correlation Ventures is looking to build a portfolio of between 75-100 companies. So far, it has backed 26 - with a new one turning up at a rate of roughly once a month. Much quicker than your typical investment firm, they said.\"We're consistently getting accolades from entrepreneurs about how fast our decision making is, and how we're meeting an unmet need,\" Mr Coats said.Other figures in the venture capitalist industry are said to be equally as impressed.\"The reaction has been tremendous,\" he added. \"When I founded it I wasn't sure what the reaction would be, but we've already made co-investments with many different venture funds.\"", "continent": ""},
